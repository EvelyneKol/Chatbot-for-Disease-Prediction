acne,"Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples or ""zits."" Whiteheads, blackheads, and red, inflamed patches of skin (such as cysts) may develop.CausesAcne occurs when tiny holes on the surface of the skin become clogged. These holes are called pores.Each pore opens to a follicle. A follicle contains a hair and an oil gland. The oil released by the gland helps remove old skin cells and keeps your skin soft.The glands can become blocked with a mixture of oil and skin cells. The blockage is called a plug or comedone. If the top of the plug is white, it is called awhitehead. It is called ablackheadif the top of the plug is dark.If bacteria become trapped in the plug, the body's immune system may react to it, causing pimples.Acne that is deep in your skin can cause hard, painfulcysts. This is called nodulocystic acne.Acne is most common in teenagers, but anyone can get acne, even babies. The problem tends to run in families.Some things that may trigger acne include:Hormonal changes that make the skin oilier. These may be related to puberty, menstrual periods, pregnancy,birth control pills, or stress.Greasy or oily cosmetic and hair products.Certain drugs (such as steroids,testosterone, estrogen, and phenytoin). Birth control devices, suc"
adhesion,"Adhesions are bands of scar-like tissue that form betweenΓ‚Β two surfaces inside the body and cause them to stick together.CausesWith movement of the body, internal organs such as the bowel or uterus are normally able to shift and to slide past each other. This is because these tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity have smooth, slippery surfaces. Inflammation (swelling), surgery, or injury can cause adhesions to form and prevent this movement. Adhesions can occur almost anywhere in the body, including:Joints, such as the shoulderEyesInside the abdomen or pelvisAdhesions can become larger or tighter over time. Problems may occur if the adhesions cause an organ or body part to:TwistPull out of positionBe unable to move normallyThe risk of forming adhesions is high after bowel or female organ surgeries. Surgery using a laparoscope is less likely to cause adhesions than open surgery.Other causes of adhesions in the abdomen or pelvis include:Appendicitis, most often when the appendix breaks open (ruptures)CancerEndometriosisInfections in the abdomen and pelvis, such as appendicitis or fallopian tube infectionRadiation treatmentAdhesions around the joints may occur:After surgery or traumaWith certain types of arthritisWith overuse of"
anemia,"Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.Different types of anemia include:Anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiencyAnemia due to folate (folic acid) deficiencyAnemia due to iron deficiencyAnemia of chronic diseaseHemolytic anemiaIdiopathic aplastic anemiaMegaloblastic anemiaPernicious anemiaSickle cell anemiaThalassemiaIron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia.CausesAlthough many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin.The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to:Chan"
arthritis,"Arthritis is inflammation or degeneration of one or more joints. A joint is the area where 2 bones meet. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis.CausesArthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage. Normal cartilage protects a joint and allows it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together. This causes swelling (inflammation), and stiffness.Other joint structures affected by arthritis include:The synoviumThe bone next to the jointLigaments and tendonsSacs that may be fluid-filled next to bone, ligaments and tendons (bursae)Joint inflammation and damage may result from:An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue)Broken boneGeneral ""wear and tear"" on jointsInfection, most often by bacteria or virusesCrystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrateIn most cases, the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated. Sometimes, it does not. When this happens, you have long-term (chronic) arthritis.Arthritis may occur in people of any age and sex.Osteoart"
asthma,"Asthma is a chronic disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. It leads to breathing difficulty such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.CausesAsthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.Asthma symptoms can be caused by breathing in substances calledallergensor triggers, or by other causes.Common asthma triggers include:Animals (pet hair or dander)Dust mitesCertain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDs)Changes in weather (most often cold weather)Chemicals in the air (pollution) or in foodPhysical activityMoldPollenRespiratory infections, such as thecommon coldand many other virusesStrong emotions (stress)Tobacco or other inhalant that is smokedSubstances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading tooccupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.Many people with asthma have a personal or family history ofallergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) oreczema. Others have no history of"
bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder is a mental condition in which a person has wide or extreme swings in their mood. Periods of feelingsad and depressedmay alternate with periods of intense excitement and activity or being cross or irritable.CausesBipolar disorder affects men and women equally. It most often starts between ages 15 and 25. The exact cause is not known, but it occurs more often in relatives of people with bipolar disorder.In most people with bipolar disorder, there is no clear cause for the periods (episodes) of extreme happiness and high activity or energy (mania) or depression and low activity or energy (depression). The following may trigger a manic episode:ChildbirthMedicines, such as antidepressants or steroidsPeriods of not being able to sleep(insomnia)Recreational drug useSymptomsThe manic phase may last from days to months. It may include these symptoms:Easily distractedExcess involvement in activitiesLittle need for sleepPoor judgmentPoor temper controlLack of self-control and reckless behavior, such as drinking or using drugs in excess, having increased and risky sex, gambling, and spending or giving away a lot of moneyVery irritable mood, racing thoughts, talking a lot, and false beliefs about self or abilitiesRapid speech"
cardiomyopathy,"Cardiomyopathy is disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, or has another structural problem. It often contributes to the heart's inability to pump or function well.Many people with cardiomyopathy haveheart failure.CausesThere are many types of cardiomyopathy, with different causes. Some of the more common ones are:Dilated cardiomyopathy (also called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy if there is no known cause) is a condition in which the heart becomes weak and the chambers get large. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood out to the body. It can be caused by many medical problems.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This makes it harder for blood to leave the heart. This type of cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families.Ischemic cardiomyopathy is caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood. It makes the heart walls thin so they do not pump well.Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a group of disorders. The heart chambers are unable to fill with blood because the heart muscle is stiff. The most common causes of this type of cardiomyopathy are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause.Peripartum "
cellulitis,"Cellulitis is a common skin infection caused by bacteria. It affects the middle layer of the skin (dermis) and the tissues below. Sometimes, muscle below the skin can be affected.CausesStaphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are the most common causes of cellulitis.Normal skin has many types of bacteria living on it. When there is a break in the skin, these bacteria can cause a skin infection.Risk factors for cellulitis include:Cracks or peeling skin between the toesHistory ofperipheral vascular diseaseInjury or trauma with a break in the skin (skin wounds)Insect bites and stings, animal bites, or human bitesUlcersfrom certain diseases, including diabetes and vascular diseaseUse of corticosteroid medicines or other medicines that suppress the immune systemWound from a recent surgerySymptomsSymptoms of cellulitis include:FeverwithchillsandsweatingFatiguePain or tenderness in the affected areaSkin redness or inflammationthat gets bigger as the infection spreadsSkin sore orrashthat starts suddenly, and grows quickly in the first 24 hoursTight, glossy, stretched appearance of the skinWarm skin in the area of rednessMuscle achesand joint stiffness from swelling of the tissue over the jointNausea and vomitingExams and TestsYour health"
cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis is a disorder in which there is wear on the cartilage (disks) and bones of the neck (cervical vertebrae). It is a common cause of chronic neck pain.CausesCervical spondylosis is caused by aging andchronicwear on the cervical spine. This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae).Over time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect your arms, legs, and balance.Everyday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them.The major risk factor is aging. By age 60, most people show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are:Being overweight and not exercisingHaving a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twistingPast neck injury (often several years before)Past spine surgeryRuptured or slipped diskSevere arthritisPrevious surgery on the neckSymptomsSymptoms often develop slowly over time. But they may start or get "
cirrhosis,"Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver and poor liver function. It is the last stage of chronic liver disease.CausesCirrhosis is most often the end result of chronic liver damage caused by long-term (chronic) liver disease. Common causes of chronic liver disease in the United States are:Hepatitis Borhepatitis Cinfection.Alcohol overuse.Buildup of fat in the liver that is NOT caused by drinking too much alcohol(called metabolic associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD] or metabolic associated steatohepatitis [MASH]). It is closely related to being overweight, having high blood pressure, diabetes or pre-diabetes, and high cholesterol.Less common causes of cirrhosis include:When immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them, called autoimmune hepatitis (AH)Bile duct disordersSome medicinesLiver diseases passed down in familiesSymptomsThere may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly, depending on how well the liver is working. Often, it is discovered by chance when an abdominal ultrasound exam is done or blood is drawn for another reason.Early symptoms include:Fatigue and loss of energyPoor appetite and weight lossNausea or belly painSmall, red spider-like blood vessels on the skinAs liver fun"
colitis,"Colitis is swelling (inflammation) of the large intestine (colon).CausesMost of the time, the cause of colitis is not known.Causes of colitis include:Infections caused by a virus or a parasiteFood poisoningdue to bacteriaCrohn diseaseUlcerative colitisLack of blood flow to the colon (ischemic colitis)Past radiation to the colon (radiation colitis and strictures)Necrotizing enterocolitisin newbornsPseudomembranous colitiscaused byClostridium difficileinfectionΓ‚Β (now calledClostridiodes difficile)SymptomsSymptoms can include:Abdominal painandbloatingΓ‚Β thatΓ‚Β may be constant or come and goBloody stoolsΓ‚Constant urge to have a bowel movement (tenesmus)DehydrationDiarrheaFeverExams and TestsThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will also be asked questions about your symptoms, such as:How long have you had the symptoms?How severe is your pain?How often do you have pain and how long does it last?How often do you have diarrhea?Have you traveled recently?Have you taken antibiotics recently?Your provider may recommend a flexiblesigmoidoscopyorcolonoscopy. During this test, a flexible tube is inserted through your rectum to examine your colon. You may have biopsies taken during this exam. Biopsies may show changes relate"
common cold,"The common cold most often causes a runny nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing. You may also have a sore throat, cough, headache, or other symptoms.CausesIt is called the common cold for good reason. There are overone billioncolds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have more colds than any other type of illness.Colds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children.Children can get many colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares.Colds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons.A cold virus spreads through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose.You can catch a cold if:A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near youYou touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknobPeople are most contagious for the first 2 to 3 days of a cold. A cold is most often not contagious after the first week.SymptomsCold symptoms usually start about 2 or 3 days after you came in contact with the"
confusion,"Confusion is the inability to think as clearly or quickly as you normally do. You may feel disoriented and have difficulty paying attention, remembering, and making decisions.ConsiderationsConfusion may come on quickly or slowly over time, depending on the cause. Many times, confusion lasts for a short time and goes away. Other times, it is permanent and not curable. It may be associated with delirium or dementia.Confusion is more common in older people and often occurs during a hospital stay.Some confused people may have strange or unusual behavior or may act aggressively.CausesConfusion may be caused by different health problems, such as:Alcoholor drug intoxicationBrain tumorHead traumaorhead injury(concussion)FeverFluid and electrolyte imbalanceIllness in an older person, such as loss of brain function (dementia)Illness in a person with existing neurological disease, such as a strokeInfectionsLack of sleep (sleep deprivation)Low blood sugarLow levels of oxygen (for example, from chronic lung disorders)MedicinesNutritional deficiencies, especiallyniacin,thiamine, orvitamin B12SeizuresSudden drop in body temperature (hypothermia)Home CareA good way to find out if someone is confused is to ask the person his or her name, age, and "
coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease is a narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is also called coronary artery disease.CausesCHD is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women.CHD is caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries to your heart. This may also be calledhardening of the arteriesor atherosclerosis.Fatty material and other substances form a plaque buildup on the walls of your coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to your heart.This buildup causes the arteries to get narrow.As a result, blood flow to the heart can slow down or stop.Arisk factor for heart diseaseis something that increases your chance of getting it. You cannot change some risk factors for heart disease, but you can change others.SymptomsIn some cases, symptoms may be very noticeable. But, you can have the disease and not have any symptoms. This is more often true in the early stages of CHD.Chest painor discomfort (angina) is the most common symptom. You feel this pain when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The pain may feel different from person to person.It may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may feel it under your b"
deep vein thrombosis,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside a part of the body. DVT mainly affects the large veins in the lower leg and thigh, but can occur in other deep veins, such as in the arms and pelvis. DVT most often affects only one side of the body.CausesDVT is most common in adults over age 60. But it can occur at any age. When a clot breaks off and moves through the bloodstream, it is called an embolism. An embolism can get stuck in the blood vessels in the brain, lungs, heart, or another area, leading to severe damage.Blood clotsmay form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins.Risk factors include:A pacemaker catheter that has been passed through a vein in the groinBed rest or sitting in one position for too long, such as plane or car travelFamily history of blood clotsFractures in the pelvis or legsGiving birth within the last 6 monthsPregnancyObesityRecent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery)Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal (polycythemia vera)Having an indwelling (long-term) catheter in a blood vesselAge greater than 60Blood is more likely to clot in someone who has cer"
dehydration,"Dehydration occurs when your body does not have as much water and fluids as it needs.Dehydration can be mild, moderate, or severe, based on how much of your body's fluid is lost or not replaced. Severe dehydration is a life-threatening emergency.CausesYou can become dehydrated if you lose too much fluid, do not drink enough water or fluids, or both.Your body may lose a lot of fluid from:Sweating too much, for example, from exercising in hot weatherFeverVomiting or diarrheaUrinating too much (uncontrolled diabetes or some medicines, like diuretics, can cause you to urinate a lot)You might not drink enough fluids because:You do not feel like eating or drinking because you are sickYou are nauseatedYou have asore throatormouth soresOlder adults and people with certain diseases, such as diabetes, are also at higher risk for dehydration.SymptomsSigns of mild to moderate dehydration include:ThirstDry or sticky mouthNot urinating muchDarker yellow urineDry, cool skinHeadacheMuscle crampsSigns of severe dehydration include:Not urinating, or very dark yellow or amber-colored urineDry, shriveled skinIrritability or confusionDizziness or lightheadednessRapid heartbeatRapid breathingSunken eyesListlessnessShock (not enough blood flow through t"
delirium,"Delirium is sudden severeconfusiondue to rapid changes in brain function that can occur with physical or mental illness.CausesDelirium is most often caused by physical or mental illness and is usually temporary and reversible. Many disorders may cause delirium. Often, these disorders do not allow the brain to get oxygen or other substances. They may also cause dangerous chemicals (toxins) to build up in the brain. Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially in older adults.Causes include:Alcohol or medicine overdose or withdrawalDrug use or overdose, including being sedated in the ICUElectrolyteor other body chemical disturbancesInfections such asurinary tract infections,pneumonia, or meningitisSevere lack of sleepPoisonsGeneral anesthesia and surgeryAutoimmune diseaseSymptomsDelirium involves a quick change between mental states (for example, fromlethargytoagitationand back to lethargy).Symptoms include:Changes in alertness(usually more alert in the morning, less alert at night)Changes in feeling (sensation) and perceptionChanges in level of consciousness or awarenessChanges in movement (for example, may be slow moving or hyperactive)Changes in sleep patterns,drowsinessConfusion (disorientation) about time or "
dementia,"Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. It affects one or more brain functions such as memory, thinking, language, judgment, or behavior. Dementia may also be referred to as majorneurocognitive disorder.CausesDementia usually occurs in older age. Most types are rare in people under age 60. The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older.Most types of dementia are nonreversible and degenerative. Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back.Alzheimer diseaseis the most common type of dementia.Another common type of dementia isvascular dementia. It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke.Lewy body disease is another cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. Any condition that results in injury to the brain can cause dementia.The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia:Huntington diseaseBrain injuryFrontotemporal degeneration(Pick disease)Multiple sclerosisInfections such asHIV/AIDS,syphilis, andLyme diseaseParkinson diseaseProgressive supranuclear palsyExcess alcohol useBrain traumaSome causes of dementia, such as "
diabetes,"Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.CausesInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both.To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.An organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:Their pancreas does not make enough insulinTheir cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance)Both of the aboveThere are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk"
diverticulitis,"Diverticula are small, bulging sacs or pouches that form on the inner wall of the intestine. Diverticulitis occurs when these pouches become inflamed or infected. Most often, these pouches are in the lower part of the large intestine (colon).CausesThe formation of pouches or sacs on the intestinal lining is called diverticulosis. It is found in more than half of Americans over age 60. However, no one knows exactly what causes the pouches to form.Eating a low-fiber diet mostly made up of processed foods may be a cause. Constipation and hard stools are more likely when you do not eat enough fiber. Straining to pass stools increases the pressure in the colon or intestines, which may lead to the formation of these pouches.In some cases, one of the pouches can become inflamed and a small tear develops in the lining of the intestine. This can lead to an infection at the site. When this occurs, the condition is called diverticulitis. The cause of diverticulitis is not known.SymptomsPeople withdiverticulosisoften have no symptoms, but they may have bloating and cramping in the lower part of the belly. Rarely, they may notice blood in their stool or on toilet paper.Symptoms of diverticulitis are more severe and often start suddenly, but th"
diverticulosis,"Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging sacs or pouches form on the inner wall of the intestine. These sacs are called diverticula. Most often, these pouches form in the large intestine (colon). They may also occur in the jejunum in the small intestine, although this is less common.CausesDiverticulosis is less common in people age 40 and younger. It's more common in older adults. About half of Americans over age 60 have this condition. Most people will have it by age 80.No one knows exactly what causes these pouches to form.For many years, it was thought that eating a low-fiber diet may play a role. Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation (hard stools). Straining to pass stools (feces) increases the pressure in the colon or intestines. This may cause the pouches to form at weak spots in the colon wall. However, whether a low-fiber diet leads to this problem is not well proven.Other possible risk factors that are also not well proven are lack of exercise and obesity.Eating nuts, popcorn, or corn does not appear to lead to inflammation of these pouches (diverticulitis).SymptomsMost people with diverticulosis have no symptoms.When symptoms occur, they may include:Pain and cramps in your stomach especially in the left lower a"
endocarditis,"Endocarditis is inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). It is caused by a bacterial or, rarely, a fungal infection.CausesEndocarditis can involve the heart muscle, heart valves, or lining of the heart. Some people who develop endocarditis have a:Birth defect of the heartDamaged or abnormal heart valveHistory of endocarditisNew heart valve after surgeryParenteral (intravenous) drug use disorder or addictionLong-term intravenous line in placeEndocarditis begins when germs enter the bloodstream and then travel to the heart.Bacterial infection is the most common cause of endocarditis.Endocarditis can also be caused by fungi, such as Candida.In some cases, no cause can be found.Germs are most likely to enter the bloodstream during:Central venous access linesInjection drug use, from the use of unclean (unsterile) needlesRecent dental surgeryOther surgeries or minor procedures to the breathing tract, urinary tract, infected skin, or bones and musclesSymptomsSymptoms of endocarditis may develop slowly or suddenly.Fever,chills, andsweatingare frequent symptoms. These sometimes can:Be present for days before any other symptoms appearCome and go, or be more noticeable at nighttimeYou may also h"
epilepsy,"Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeatedseizuresover time. Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal electrical activity of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior such as bodily movements.CausesEpilepsy occurs when changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain cells send out abnormal electrical signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.)Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or, the cause may be unknown (idiopathic).Common causes of epilepsy include:Strokeortransient ischemic attack(TIA)Dementia, such as Alzheimer diseaseTraumatic brain injuryInfections, includingbrain abscess,meningitis,encephalitis, andHIV/AIDSBrain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect)Brain injury that occurs during or near birthMetabolism disorders present at birth (such asphenylketonuria)Brain tumorAbnormal blood vessels in the brainOther illness that damages or destroys brain tissueSeizure disorders that run in families (hereditary epilepsy)Epileptic seizures can happen to anyone at any age. However, they're more common in young childr"
gastritis,"Gastritis occurs when the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed or swollen.Gastritis may last for only a short time (acute gastritis) or it may linger for months to years (chronic gastritis).CausesThe most common causes of gastritis are:Certain medicines, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen and other similar drugsHeavy alcohol drinkingInfection of the stomach with a bacteria calledHelicobacter pyloriLess common causes are:Autoimmune disorders (such as pernicious anemia)Backflow of bile into the stomach (bile reflux)Cocaine useEating or drinking caustic or corrosive substances (such as poisons)Extreme stressViral infection, such as cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus (more often occurs in people with a weak immune system)Trauma or a severe, sudden illness such as major surgery, kidney failure, or being placed on a breathing machine may cause gastritis.SymptomsMany people with gastritis do not have any symptoms.Symptoms you may notice are:Loss of appetiteNausea and vomitingPain in the upper part of the belly or abdomenIf gastritis is causing bleeding from the lining of the stomach, symptoms may include:Black stoolsVomiting bloodor coffee-ground-like materialExams and TestsTests that may be needed are:Complete blood count(C"
gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the stomach contents leak backward from the stomach into the esophagus (food pipe). Food travels from your mouth to the stomach through your esophagus. GERD can irritate the food pipe and cause heartburn and other symptoms.CausesWhen you eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).When this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux may cause symptoms. Harsh stomach acids can also damage the lining of the esophagus.The risk factors for reflux include:Use of alcohol (possibly)Hiatal hernia(a condition in which part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities)ObesityPregnancySclerodermaSmoking or tobacco useLying down within 3 hours after eatingHeartburn and gastroesophageal reflux can be caused by or made worse by pregnancy. Symptoms can also be caused by certain medicines, such as:Anticholinergics (for example, sea"
glaucoma,"Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain.Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure.CausesGlaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma:Open-angle glaucomaAngle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucomaCongenital glaucomaSecondary glaucomaThe front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that is in front of the iris, pupil, and angle.Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye.In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow.In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden.Either type can damage the optic nerve.Open-angle glaucomais the most common type of glaucoma.The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over tim"
gout,"Gout is a type of arthritis. It occurs whenuric acidbuilds up in the blood and causes inflammation in the joints.Acute gout is a painful condition that often affects only one joint. Chronic gout is the repeated episodes of pain and inflammation. More than one joint may be affected.Watch this video about:GoutCausesGout is caused by having higher-than-normal level of uric acid in your body. This may occur if:Your body makes too much uric acidYour body has a hard time getting rid of uric acidWhen uric acid builds up in the fluid around the joints (synovial fluid), uric acid crystals form. These crystals cause the joint to become inflamed, causing pain, swelling and warmth.The exact cause is unknown. Gout may run in families. The problem is more common in men, in women after menopause, and people who drink alcohol. As people become older, gout becomes more common.The condition may also develop in people with:DiabetesKidney diseaseObesitySickle cell anemiaand otheranemiasLeukemiaand other blood cancersGout may occur after taking medicines that interfere with the removal of uric acid from the body. People who take certain medicines, such as hydrochlorothiazide and other water pills, may have a higher level of uric acid in the blood.Symp"
heart attack,"Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to the heart. If the blood flow is blocked, the heart is starved of oxygen and heart cells die.The medical term for this is myocardial infarction.CausesA substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells.A heart attack may occur when:A disruption in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack.The cause of heart attack is not always known, but there are well known risk factors.Heart attack may occur:When you are resting or asleepAfter a sudden increase in physical activityWhen you are active outside in cold weatherAfter sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illnessManyrisk factors may lead to the development of plaque buildup and a heart attack.SymptomsA heart attack is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.DO NOT try to drive your"
hemorrhoids,"Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus or lower part of the rectum.CausesHemorrhoids are very common. They result from increased pressure on the anus. This can occur during pregnancy or childbirth, and due to constipation. The pressure causes the normal anal veins and tissue to swell. This tissue can bleed, often during bowel movements.Hemorrhoids may be caused by:Straining during bowel movementsConstipationSitting for long periods of time, especially on the toiletCertain diseases, such ascirrhosisHemorrhoids may be inside or outside the body.Internal hemorrhoids occur just inside the anus, at the beginning of the rectum. When they are large, they may fall outside (prolapse). The most common problem with internal hemorrhoids is bleeding during bowel movements.External hemorrhoids occur outside the anus. They can result in difficulty cleaning the area after a bowel movement. If a blood clot forms in an external hemorrhoid, it can be very painful (thrombosed external hemorrhoid).SymptomsHemorrhoids are most often not painful, but if a blood clot forms, they can be very painful.Common symptoms include:Painless bright red blood from the rectumAnal itchingAnal ache or pain, especially while sittingPain during bowel movementsOne or m"
hepatitis,"Hepatitis is swelling and inflammation of the liver.CausesHepatitis can be caused by:Immune cells in the body attacking the liver(autoimmune hepatitis)Infections from viruses (such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C), bacteria, or parasitesLiver damage from alcohol or poisonMedicines, such as an overdose of acetaminophenFatty liverLiver disease can also be caused by inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis or hemochromatosis, a condition that involves having too much iron in your body.Other causes include Wilson disease, a disorder in which the body retains too much copper and ingestion of toxic mushrooms.SymptomsHepatitis may start and get better quickly. It may also become a long-term condition. In some cases, hepatitis may lead to liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer or even death.There are several factors that can affect how severe the condition is. These may include the cause of the liver damage and any illnesses you have. Hepatitis A, for example, is most often short-term and does not lead to chronic liver problems.The symptoms of hepatitis include:Pain or bloating in the belly areaDark urine and pale or clay-colored stoolsFatigueLow grade feverItchingJaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)Loss o"
hepatitis a,"Hepatitis A is inflammation (irritation and swelling) of the liver from the hepatitis A virus.CausesThe hepatitis A virus is found mostly in the stool and blood of an infected person. The virus is present about 15 to 45 days before symptoms occur and during the first week of illness.You can catch hepatitis A if:You eat or drink food or water that has been contaminated by stools (feces) containing the hepatitis A virus. Unpeeled and uncooked fruits and vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease.You come in contact with the stool or blood of a person who currently has the disease.A person with hepatitis A passes the virus to an object or food due to poor hand-washing after using the toilet.You take part in sexual practices that involve oral-anal contact.Not everyone has symptoms with hepatitis A infection. Therefore, many more people are infected than are diagnosed or reported.Risk factors include:Overseas travel, especially to Asia, South or Central America, Africa and the Middle EastInjection drug useLiving in a nursing homeWorking in a health care, food, or sewage industryEating raw shellfish such as oysters and clamsOther common hepatitis virus infections include hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Hepatiti"
hepatitis b,"Hepatitis B is irritation and swelling (inflammation) of the liver due to infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV).Other types of viral hepatitis includehepatitis A,hepatitis C,hepatitis D, and hepatitis E.CausesYou can catch hepatitis B infection through contact with the blood or body fluids (semen, vaginal fluids, and saliva) of a person who has the virus.Exposure may occur:After a needlestick or sharps injuryIf any blood or other body fluid touches your skin, eyes or mouth, or open sores or cutsPeople who may be at risk for hepatitis B are those who:Have unprotected sex with an infected partnerReceive blood transfusions (not common in the United States)Have contact with blood at work (such as health care workers)Have been on long-term kidney dialysisGet a tattoo or acupuncture with unclean needlesShare needles or straws during drug useShare personal items (such as toothbrush, razor, and nail clippers) with a person who has the virusWere born to a hepatitis-B infected motherAll blood used for blood transfusions is screened, so the chance of getting the virus in this way is very small.SymptomsAfter you first become infected with the HBV:You may have no symptoms.You may feel sick for a period of days or weeks.You may become very"
hepatitis c,"Hepatitis C is a viral disease that leads to swelling (inflammation) of the liver.Other types of viral hepatitis include:Hepatitis AHepatitis BHepatitis DHepatitis ECausesHepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV).You can catch hepatitis C if the blood of someone who has HCV enters your body. Exposure may occur:After a needle stick or sharps injuryIf blood from someone who has HCV contacts a cut on your skin or contacts your eyes or mouthWhile injecting street drugsPeople at risk for HCV are those who:Inject street drugs or share a needle with someone who has HCVHave been on long-term kidney dialysisHave regular contact with blood at work (such as a health care worker)Have unprotected sexual contact with a person who has HCVWere born to a mother who had HCVReceived a tattoo or acupuncture with needles that were not disinfected properly after being used on another person (risk is very low with practitioners who have a tattoo license or permit or an acupuncture license)Received an organ transplant from a donor who has HCVShare personal items, such as toothbrushes and razors, with someone who has HCV (less common)Received ablood transfusion(rare in the United States since blood screening became available in 1992)S"
hernia,"A hernia is a sac formed by the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). The sac comes through a hole or weak area in the strong layer of the belly wall that surrounds the muscle. This layer is called the fascia.Which type of hernia you have depends on where it is:Femoral herniais a bulge in the upper thigh, just below the groin. This type is more common in women than men.Hiatal herniaoccurs in the diaphragm muscle that separates the chest and abdomen. Part of the upper stomach pushes into the chest.Incisional herniacan occur through a scar if you have had abdominal surgery in the past.Umbilical herniais a bulge around the belly button. It occurs when the muscle around the belly button does not close completely after birth.Inguinal herniais a bulge in the groin. It is more common in men. It may go all the way down into the scrotum.CausesUsually, there is no clear cause of a hernia. Sometimes, hernias can occur due to:Heavy liftingStraining while using the toiletAny activity that raises the pressure inside the bellyHernias may be present at birth, but the bulge may not be evident until later in life. Some people have a family history of hernias.Babies and children can get hernias. It happens when there is weakness in the belly "
hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. The condition is often called overactive thyroid.CausesThe thyroid gland is an important organ of theendocrinesystem. It is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet. The gland makes the hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is calledmetabolism.Many diseases and conditions can cause hyperthyroidism, including:Graves disease(most common cause of hyperthyroidism)Inflammation (thyroiditis) of the thyroid due to viral infections, some medicines, or after pregnancy (common)Taking too much thyroid hormone (common)Noncancerous growths of the thyroid gland or pituitary gland (rare)Some tumors of thetestesor ovaries (rare)Getting medical imaging tests with contrast dye that has iodine (rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid)Eating too much of foods that contain iodine (very rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid)SymptomsCommon symptoms include:AnxietyDifficulty concentratingFatigueFrequent bowel movementsGoiter(visibly enlarged thyroid gland) orthyroid nodulesHair lossHand tremorHeat intoleranceIncreased appetiteIncreased sweatingIrregu"
hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. This condition is often called underactive thyroid.CausesThe thyroid gland is an important organ of theendocrine system. It is located at the front of the neck, just above where your collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is calledmetabolism.Hypothyroidism is more common in women and people over age 50.The most common cause of hypothyroidism is thyroiditis. In people with thyroiditis, swelling and inflammation damage the thyroid gland's cells.Causes of this problem include:The immune system attacking the thyroid glandViral infections (common cold) or other respiratory infectionsPregnancy (often called postpartum thyroiditis)Other causes of hypothyroidism include:Certain medicines, such as lithium and amiodarone, and some types ofchemotherapyCongenital (birth) defectsRadiation treatments to the neck or brain to treat different cancersRadioactive iodine used to treat an overactive thyroid glandSurgical removal of part or all of the thyroid glandSheehan syndrome, a condition that may occur in a woman who bleeds severely during pregnancy or childbirth and causes the "
impetigo,"Impetigo is a common skin infection.CausesImpetigo is caused by streptococcus (strep) or staphylococcus (staph) bacteria. Methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA) is an increasing cause.Skin typically has many types of bacteria on it. When there is a break in the skin, bacteria can enter the body and grow there. This causes inflammation and infection. Breaks in the skin may occur from injury or trauma to the skin or from insect, animal, or human bites.Impetigo may also occur on the skin, where there is no visible break.Impetigo is most common in children who live in unhealthy conditions.In adults, it may occur following another skin problem. It may also develop after a cold or other virus.Impetigo can spread to others. You can catch the infection from someone who has it if the fluid that oozes from their skin blisters touches an open area on your skin.SymptomsSymptoms of impetigo are:One or many blisters that are filled with pus and easy to pop. In infants, the skin is reddish or raw-looking where a blister has broken.Blisters that itch are filled with yellow or honey-colored fluid and ooze and crust over.Rashthat may begin as a single spot but spreads to other areas due to scratching.Skin sores on the face, lips, arms, or legs t"
jaundice,"Jaundice is a yellow color of the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes. The yellow coloring comes from bilirubin, a byproduct of old red blood cells. Jaundice can be a symptom of several health problems.CausesA small number of red blood cells in your body die each day, and are replaced by new ones. The liver removes the old blood cells. This creates bilirubin. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed by the body through the stool.Jaundice can occur when too much bilirubin builds up in the body.Jaundice can occur if:Too many red blood cells are dying or breaking down and going to the liver.The liver is overloaded or damaged.The bilirubin from the liver is unable to move normally into the digestive tract.Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Things that cancause jaundiceinclude:Infections, most commonly viralUse of certain drugsCancer of the liver, bile ducts or pancreasBlood disorders, gallstones, birth defects and a number of other medical conditionsSymptomsJaundice may appear suddenly or develop slowly over time. Symptoms of jaundice commonly include:Yellow skin and the white part of the eyes (sclera) -- when jaundice is more severe, these areas may look brownYellow color "
malaria,"Malaria is a parasitic disease that involves high fevers, shaking chills, flu-like symptoms, andanemia.CausesMalaria is caused by a parasite. It is passed to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. After infection, the parasites (called sporozoites) travel through the bloodstream to the liver. There, they mature and release another form of parasites, called merozoites. The parasites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells (RBCs).The parasites multiply inside the red blood cells. The cells then break open within 48 to 72 hours and infect more red blood cells. The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection. The symptoms occur in cycles of 48 to 72 hours.Most symptoms are caused by:The release of merozoites into the bloodstreamAnemia resulting from the destruction of the red blood cellsLarge amounts of free hemoglobin being released into circulation after red blood cells break open, which can damage other organs such as the kidneysMalaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions. Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite disappe"
melanoma,"Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. It is also the rarest. It is the leading cause of death from skin disease.Other common types of skin cancer aresquamous cell carcinomaandbasal cell carcinoma.CausesMelanoma is caused by changes (mutations) in skin cells called melanocytes. These cells make a skin color pigment called melanin. Melanin is responsible for skin and hair color.Melanoma can appear on normal skin. Sometimes it can develop from moles. Moles that are present at birth may develop into melanomas. Larger moles that are present at birth may be at higher risk for developing melanoma.There are four major types of melanoma:Superficial spreading melanomais the most common type. It is usually flat and irregular in shape and color, with different shades of black and brown. It is most common in fair skin people.Nodular melanomausually starts as a raised area that is dark blackish-blue or bluish-red. Some do not have any color (amelanotic melanoma).Lentigo maligna melanomausually occurs in older people. It is most common in sun-damaged skin on the face, neck, and arms. The abnormal skin areas are usually large, flat, and tan with areas of brown.Acral lentiginous melanomais the least common form. It usually occurs on "
migraine,"A migraine is a type of headache. It may occur with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound. In most people, a throbbing pain is felt only on one side of the head.CausesA migraine headache is caused by abnormal brain activity. This activity can be triggered by many things. But the exact chain of events remains unclear. Most medical experts believe the attack begins in the brain and involves nerve pathways and chemicals. The changes affect blood flow in the brain and surrounding tissues.Migraine headaches tend to first appear between the ages of 10 and 45. Sometimes, they begin earlier or later. Migraines may run in families. Migraines occur more often in women than men. Some women, but not all, have fewer migraines when they are pregnant.Migraine attacks may be triggered by any of the following:Caffeine withdrawalChanges in hormone levels during a woman's menstrual cycle or with the use of birth control pillsChanges in sleep patterns, such as not getting enough sleepDrinking alcoholExercise or other physical stressLoud noises or bright lightsMissed mealsOdors or perfumesSmoking or exposure to smokeStress and anxietyMigraines can also be triggered by certain foods. Most common are:ChocolateDairy foods, "
obesity,"Obesity means weighing more than what is healthy for a given height. Obesity is a serious, chronic disease. It can lead to other health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.CausesTaking in more calories than your body uses can lead to obesity. This is because your body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:Eating more food than your body can useDrinking too much alcoholNot getting enough exerciseMany people with obesity who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods develop obesity, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work as well as it should.The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to s"
osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis is a bone infection. It is caused by bacteria or other germs.CausesA bone infection is most often caused by bacteria. But it can also be caused by fungi or other germs. When a person has osteomyelitis:Bacteria or other germs may spread to a bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore.The infection can start in another part of the body and spread to the bone through the blood.The infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone.In children, thelong bonesof the arms or legs are most often involved. In adults, the feet, spine bones (vertebrae), and hips (pelvis) are most commonly affected.Risk factors are:DiabetesHemodialysisPoor blood supplyRecent injuryUse of injected illicit drugsSurgery involving bonesWeakened immune systemSymptomsSymptoms of osteomyelitis are often not specific and vary with age. Main symptoms include:Bone painExcessive sweatingFever and chillsGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)Localswelling, redness, and warmthOpen wound that may show pusPain at the site of infectionExams and TestsYour health care provider will examine you"
osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile and more likely to break (fracture).CausesOsteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease.Osteoporosis increases the risk for breaking a bone. About one half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebra (bones of the spine) during their lifetime. Spine fractures are the most common.Your body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy bones.During your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone.As long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong.Bone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created.Sometimes, bone loss occurs without any known cause. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families. In general, white, older women are the most likely to have bone loss.Brittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body reabsorb too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough new bone. As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker.Watch this video about:OsteoporosisA major risk is not consu"
parkinson disease,"Parkinson disease results from certain brain cells dying. These cells help control movement and coordination. The disease leads to shaking (tremors) andtrouble walking and moving.CausesNerve cells use a brain chemical called dopamine to help control muscle movement. With Parkinson disease, the brain cells that makedopamineslowly die. Without enough dopamine, the cells that control movement can't send proper messages to the muscles. This makes it hard to control the muscles. Slowly, over time, this damage gets worse. No one knows exactly why these brain cells waste away.Parkinson disease most often develops after age 60. It is one of the most common nervous system problems in older adults.The disease affects men more often than women, although women also develop the disease. Parkinson disease sometimes runs in families.The disease can occur in younger adults. In such cases, it is often due to the person's genes.Parkinson disease is rare in children.Watch this video about:Parkinson diseaseSymptomsSymptoms may be mild at first. For instance, you may have a mild tremor or a slight feeling that one leg is stiff and dragging. Jaw tremor has also been an early sign of Parkinson disease. Symptoms may affect one or both sides of the body.G"
psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes skin redness, silvery scales, and irritation. Most people with psoriasis have thick, red, well-defined patches of skin with flaky, silver-whitescales. This is called plaque psoriasis.CausesPsoriasis is common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 10 and 35, or as people get older.Psoriasis isn't contagious. This means it doesn't spread to other people.Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families.Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, on average this process takes place within 7 to14 days. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin's surface, forming the collections of scales.The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat:Infections from bacteria or viruses, includingstrep throatand upper respiratory infectionsDry air or dry skinInjury to the skin, including cuts, burns, insect bites, and other skin rashesSome medicines, including antimalaria medicines, beta-blockers, and lithiumStressToo little sunlightToo much sunlight (sunburn)Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system, including people withHIV/AIDS.Some people with psoriasis al"
schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that makes it hard to tell the difference between what is real and not real.It also makes it hard to think clearly, have normal emotional responses, and act normally in social situations.CausesSchizophrenia is a complex illness. Mental health experts are not sure what causes it. Genes may play a role.Schizophrenia occurs in just as many men as women. It usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it may begin later in life. In women, it tends to begin slightly later.Schizophrenia in children usually begins after age 5. Childhood schizophrenia (younger than 13) is rare and can be hard to tell apart from other developmental problems.SymptomsSymptoms usually develop slowly over months or years. The person may have many symptoms, or only a few.People with schizophrenia may have trouble keeping friends and working. They may also have problems withanxiety,depression, andsuicidal thoughts or behaviors.Early symptoms may include:Irritable or tense feelingsTrouble concentratingTrouble sleepingAs the illness continues, the person may have problems with thinking, emotions, and behavior, including:Hearing or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)IsolationReduced emotions in tone of voice "

transient ischemic attack,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time. A person will have stroke-like symptoms for up to 24 hours. In most cases, the symptoms last for 1 to 2 hours.A transient ischemic attack is a warning sign that a truestrokemay happen in the future (often near future) if something is not done to prevent it.CausesA TIA is different than a stroke. After a TIA, the blockage breaks up quickly and dissolves on its own. A TIA does not cause brain tissue to die.The loss of blood flow to an area of the brain can be caused by:A blood clot in an artery of the brainA blood clot that travels to the brain from somewhere else in the body (for example, from the heart)An injury to blood vesselsNarrowing of a blood vessel in the brain or leading to the brainHigh blood pressureis the main risk factor for TIAs and stroke. Other majorrisk factorsare:Irregular heartbeat calledatrial fibrillationDiabetesFamily history of strokeBeing maleHigh cholesterolTendency to have abnormal blood clottingIncreasing age, especially after age 55Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of stroke)SmokingAlcohol useRecreational drug useHistory of prior TIA or strokePeople who have heart disease orpoor blood"
varicose veins,"Varicose veins are swollen, twisted, and enlarged veins that you can see under the skin. They are often red or blue in color. They most often appear in the legs, but can occur in other parts of the body.CausesNormally, one-way valves in your leg veins keep blood moving up toward the heart. When the valves do not work properly, they allow blood to back up into the vein. The vein swells from the blood that collects there, which causes varicose veins over time.Varicose veins are common, and affect more women than men. They do not cause problems for most people. However, if the flow of blood through veins becomes poor enough, problems such as leg swelling and pain, blood clots, and skin changes may be present.Risk factors include:Older ageBeing female (hormonal changes from puberty, pregnancy, and menopause can lead to varicose veins, and taking birth control pills or hormone replacement can increase your risk)Being born with defective valves in the veinsObesityPregnancyHistory of blood clots in your legsStanding or sitting for long periods of timeFamily history of varicose veinsSymptomsSymptoms of varicose veins include:Fullness, heaviness, aching, and sometimespain in the legsVisible, swollen veinsVery small veins that you can see o"
bronchitis,BronchitisBronchitis is inflammation of the airways in the lungs that is usually caused by an infection. It often gets better without treatment in around 3 weeks.
dengue,"DengueDengue, also known as dengue fever, is an infection spread by mosquitoes. It's not usually serious and often gets better on its own. Some people get a more severe type of dengue, but this is rare."
aphasia,"Aphasia is when a person has difficulty with their language or speech. It's usually caused by damage to the left side of the brain (for example, after a stroke). Symptoms of aphasia: people with aphasia often have trouble with the 4 main ways people understand and use language. These are: reading, listening, speaking, typing or writing. Speaking problems are perhaps the most obvious, and people with aphasia may make mistakes with the words they use. This could be sometimes using the wrong sounds in a word, choosing the wrong word, or putting words together incorrectly. Although aphasia affects a person's ability to communicate, it doesn't affect their intelligence. Aphasia can occur by itself or alongside other disorders, such as visual difficulties, mobility problems, limb weakness, and problems with memory or thinking skills. Causes of aphasia: aphasia is caused by damage to parts of the brain responsible for understanding and producing language. Common causes include: stroke – the most common cause of aphasia, severe head injury, a brain tumour, progressive neurological conditions – conditions that cause the brain and nervous system to become damaged over time, such as dementia. Aphasia can affect people of all ages, but it's most common in people over the age of 65, because strokes and progressive neurological conditions tend to affect older adults. Complications of aphasia: the challenges of living with aphasia can impact how a person feels and interacts with others. In some cases, it can lead to isolation, anxiety, and depression. If you're concerned about someone with aphasia, encourage them to discuss any problems with their GP or a member of their care team to access the relevant support. If the person is unable to do this themselves, they may require someone to communicate on their behalf."
pneumonia,"Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs, usually caused by an infection. Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks, but babies, older people, and people with heart or lung conditions are at risk of getting seriously ill and may need treatment in hospital. Symptoms of pneumonia Symptoms of pneumonia can start suddenly or gradually over a few days. They include: a cough – you may cough up yellow or green mucus (phlegm) shortness of breath a high temperature chest pain an aching body feeling very tired loss of appetite making wheezing noises when you breathe – babies may also make grunting noises feeling confused – this is common in older people Treatment for pneumonia You'll usually be given antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. Some people are more at risk of becoming seriously ill. You may need to go to hospital for treatment if: you're over 65 you have cardiovascular disease or a long-term lung condition your baby or young child has pneumonia you're very unwell In hospital you'll usually be given fluids and antibiotics to treat the infection. You may also be given oxygen to help you breathe. You may be sent for an X-ray of your chest and blood tests to check for other conditions. If you're given antibiotics to take at home, contact your doctor if you do not feel better after taking them for 2 to 3 days. Causes of pneumonia Pneumonia is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. You can catch pneumonia from someone who has it, or you can sometimes get it if you have another infection such as: flu respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) COVID-19 Pneumonia can be caused by a fungal infection, but this is rare in healthy people in the UK. It may also be caused by something getting into your lungs, such as water or food (aspiration pneumonia). How to reduce your risk of pneumonia There are several vaccines available to help protect you or your child from infections that can cause pneumonia: pneumococcal vaccine – recommended for babies, adults over 65 and people at higher risk of pneumococcal infections flu vaccine – recommended during pregnancy, for adults over 65, people with certain long-term health conditions and those at high risk of catching or passing on flu RSV vaccine – recommended for adults aged 75 to 79, and during pregnancy (from 28 weeks onwards) to help protect your baby after they're born COVID-19 vaccine – a seasonal vaccine that's recommended for people at increased risk from COVID-19"
(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo,"Vertigo often gets better without treatment. See a GP if it keeps coming back or is affecting your daily life. Check if it's vertigo Vertigo feels like you or everything around you is spinning – enough to affect your balance. It's more than just feeling dizzy. A vertigo attack can last from a few seconds to hours. If you have severe vertigo, it can last for many days or months. Things you can do to help ease vertigo There are things you can do to ease vertigo symptoms when they're happening, and to reduce how often it happens. Do lie still in a quiet, dark room to reduce the spinning feeling move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities sit down straight away when you feel dizzy turn on the lights if you get up at night use a walking stick if you're at risk of falling sleep with your head slightly raised on 2 or more pillows get out of bed slowly and sit on the edge of the bed for a while before standing up try to relax – anxiety can make vertigo worse Don’t do not bend over to pick things up – squat to lower yourself instead do not stretch your neck – for example, while reaching up to a high shelf What causes vertigo Inner ear problems, which affect balance, are the most common causes of vertigo. These include: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where specific head movements cause vertigo labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection caused by a cold or flu virus vestibular neuritis – inflammation of the vestibular nerve Ménière's disease – a rare inner ear condition, which sometimes involves ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or loss of hearing Other things that can cause vertigo include: migraine some types of medicine – check the leaflet to see if it's listed as a side effect Sometimes the cause is unknown."
 accident cerebrovascular,"A stroke, also referred to as a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or a brain attack, is an interruption in the flow of blood to cells in the brain. Check for signs of a stroke The main symptoms of a stroke can happen suddenly. They may include: face weakness – one side of your face may droop (fall) and it might be hard to smile arm weakness – you may not be able to fully lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm speech problems – you may slur your words or sound confused The easiest way to remember these symptoms is the word FAST. This stands for: face, arms, speech and time to call 999. Other symptoms of a stroke There are other signs that you or someone else is having a stroke. These include: weakness or numbness down 1 side of your body blurred vision or loss of sight in 1 or both eyes finding it difficult to speak or think of words confusion and memory loss feeling dizzy or falling over a severe headache Symptoms of a stroke can sometimes stop after a short time, so you may think you're OK. Even if this happens, get medical help straight away. A stroke is more likely to happen if you're older, but it can happen at any age. Medicines for a stroke Treatments you may be given, often long term, include: anticoagulants to stop blood clots forming medicines to lower your blood pressure statins to lower your cholesterol Strokes affect people in different ways. For some, it may take days or weeks to recover and there will be little impact on their life. For others, recovery can take months or years and may mean making life changes. This can include things such as adapting your home to make it easier to move around. You may have to stop work for a while or long term. Your recovery will depend on how much a stroke has affected you physically and mentally, and your rehabilitation plan. The exercises, activities and therapy sessions you do as part of your rehabilitation are often difficult, but it will help you make progress. The plan given to you by your healthcare team will help you set goals. Getting family and friends involved can also help you get better. A stroke can happen to anyone at any age, but your risk may increase if: you're over 50 years old you're from a Black or South Asian background you have sickle cell disease (SCD) you have an unhealthy lifestyle you have migraines you take the combined contraceptive pill you're pregnant and have pre-eclampsia you've just had a baby Certain conditions also increase the risk of stroke. These include: high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes irregular and fast heartbeats (atrial fibrillation) high cholesterol a transient ischaemic attack (TIA or mini stroke) Reducing the risk of a stroke If you have a stroke, or a transient ischaemic stroke (TIA, or mini-stroke), you're more at risk of having another stroke. But there are things you can do to lower the risk. Do quit smoking eat a balanced diet exercise cut down on alcohol Don’t do not forget to take medicines for any underlying conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes – talk to a GP if you have any problems with your medicine."
 acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome,"HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus. While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can. There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan. Symptoms of HIV infection Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected. Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested. Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk. Causes of HIV infection HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk. It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include: sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex. HIV from infected blood before 1996 If you received a blood transfusion or blood products before 1996, there's a chance you may have been infected with HIV. Diagnosing HIV Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. It's important to be aware that: emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help: clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Treatment for HIV Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test."
adenocarcinoma,"Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer. It starts in the glands that line your organs. Adenocarcinoma cancers can affect several areas of your body, including your lungs, stomach, pancreas and colon. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Survival rates vary depending on the location, stage and type of adenocarcinoma. What are the symptoms of adenocarcinoma? Adenocarcinoma symptoms vary widely depending on which type you have. Some of the most common overlapping symptoms are: Pain near the affected organ. Blood in bodily fluids (like your pee, poop or saliva). Changes in your appetite or weight. Bloating. Lung adenocarcinoma The first symptom of adenocarcinoma of the lungs is usually a chronic cough. You may cough up saliva and mucus with small amounts of blood. Other symptoms may include: Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Wheezing. Hoarseness. Breast adenocarcinoma Healthcare providers usually find adenocarcinoma of the breast on a mammogram in the early stages before most symptoms start. Other times, you may notice certain warning signs, including: A change in a breast’s shape or size. Discolored, flaky, dimpled or uneven skin on your breast or nipple. Bloody fluid leaking from your nipple. Colorectal adenocarcinoma You may not notice any symptoms if the tumor hasn’t grown big enough. Even though colorectal adenocarcinoma typically causes bleeding in your stool (poop), the amount may be too small to see. Here are some other symptoms to watch for: Abdominal pain. Diarrhea. Constipation. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma Most people who have adenocarcinoma of the pancreas don’t have symptoms until the late stages. The first warning signs are usually stomach pain and unintentional weight loss. Other symptoms include: Back pain. Heartburn. Nausea and vomiting. Poop that floats. Prostatic adenocarcinoma Most of the time, there are no early symptoms of prostate adenocarcinoma. In the advanced stages, you may develop erectile dysfunction or notice that you pee more than usual. Esophageal adenocarcinoma Symptoms of esophageal adenocarcinoma may include: Difficulty swallowing. Indigestion. Coughing. Hoarseness. Pressure or burning in your chest. Gastric (stomach) adenocarcinoma Stomach adenocarcinoma symptoms may include: Feeling full after eating small amounts of food. Difficulty swallowing. Nausea. Indigestion. What causes adenocarcinoma? Adenocarcinoma happens when cells in the glands that line your organs divide uncontrollably and start to spread. Experts aren’t always sure why some people develop adenocarcinoma, but there are a few risk factors to consider: Smoking or vaping: Tobacco use is the primary cause of adenocarcinoma and other types of cancer. Family history: If you have a biological parent, sibling or grandparent with adenocarcinoma, you’re more likely to develop it. Alcohol: How often you drink beverages containing alcohol may contribute to adenocarcinoma, especially if you have a family history of the condition. Toxin exposure: Harmful toxins in your home or work environment can also cause adenocarcinoma. A body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 (having overweight/obesity): Carrying extra weight may be a risk factor for certain types of cancer, including adenocarcinoma. Previous radiation therapy: If you’ve had radiation therapy in the past, you have a higher risk of developing adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis and Tests How is adenocarcinoma diagnosed? A healthcare provider will start with a physical exam. They’ll ask about your symptoms and run some tests. These tests may include: Blood tests: Your blood can show signs of cancer, like high levels of certain enzymes or low red blood cell count. CT scan: This procedure takes detailed, three-dimensional images of the tissues inside your body. A CT scan helps your healthcare provider see if there’s anything abnormal going on. MRI: This imaging test uses radio waves and magnets to capture images of your organs and tissues. Biopsy: A healthcare provider takes a small sample of tissue from the affected organ. They’ll send it to a pathologist who’ll check it for cancer cells. A biopsy can tell you whether your cancer is in one organ or if it has spread and how much it has grown. How do doctors determine cancer grade? Healthcare providers look at cell differentiation to determine what grade of adenocarcinoma you have. Differentiation relates to how abnormal your cancer cells look under a microscope: Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma: Low-grade cancer that tends to grow and spread slowly. Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma: Intermediate-grade cancer that grows faster than well-differentiated cells. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma: High-grade cancer that spreads faster than moderately differentiated cells. Adenocarcinoma stages Once you receive a diagnosis, your healthcare provider will stage the cancer. How they stage it can differ depending on the location. But here are some general guidelines: Stage 0 adenocarcinoma: The cancer hasn’t spread beyond where it started. This is adenocarcinoma in situ (meaning “in the original place”). Stage I (1) adenocarcinoma: Cancer cells have spread into some surrounding tissue but haven’t spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Stage II (2) adenocarcinoma: The cancer has spread deeper into surrounding tissue and possibly to nearby lymph nodes. It hasn’t spread to other organs. Stage III (3) adenocarcinoma: Cancer cells have spread into deeper layers of tissue, nearby lymph nodes and possibly into distant lymph nodes. The tumor may grow larger at this stage. Stage IV (4) adenocarcinoma: The cancer has traveled from the original location to other, distant parts of your body. This is metastatic adenocarcinoma."
affect labile,"A labile affect is characterized by emotions that shift quickly, drastically, and uncontrollably. Labile affect is typically associated with an underlying health condition. It can be a symptom of a mental health condition, or it can occur with conditions that affect the brain. Symptoms of a Labile Affect It's normal to experience various emotions throughout the day, but these shifts in mood are typically related to things that happen or thoughts that are occurring. People with a labile affect often experience extreme emotional reactions that may not relate to their current situation. These emotions are very strong and can seem to come out of nowhere. Oftentimes, these severe mood changes can interfere with daily activities. Strong emotional reactions that shift rapidly are the main symptom of a labile affect. These can include: Uncontrollable laughter Crying (without a specific cause) Inappropriate behavior for the situation (such as laughing at a funeral) Low tolerance for frustration Overreaction to situations Other Names for Labile Affect Emotional lability Labile mood Emotional incontinence Pathological laughing and crying Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) Involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) Causes of a Labile Affect People with certain neurological conditions and those with brain injuries can develop a specific type of labile affect called pseudobulbar affect (PBA). These medical conditions affect the way the brain controls emotion, which leads to unpredictable outbursts of laughing or crying. These conditions include: Traumatic brain injury Stroke Dementia Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Brain tumors A labile affect can also occur with certain mental health and medical conditions, though the mood changes are not as sudden or inappropriate to the situation (like laughing uncontrollably in a serious setting). Mental health causes of a labile affect include: Major depressive disorder Anxiety disorders Bipolar disorder Personality disorders What Medications Can Cause a Labile Affect? Medications that may have a labile affect as a side effect include oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and some antidepressants. Are There Tests to Diagnose the Cause of a Labile Affect? There are no tests to directly diagnose a labile affect. However, routine testing may be done to determine an underlying cause, such as a brain injury. Mental health conditions that cause a labile affect are diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This clinical handbook gives mental health professionals specific criteria for determining whether or not a mental health condition is present. Pseudobulbular affect (PBA) is diagnosed using history, mental status examinations, and neurological testing. Sometimes standardized questionnaires and scales are used. Certain criteria that might support the diagnosis of PBA include: Emotional outbursts are unrelated to the current situation. Emotions being expressed do not reflect how the person is actually feeling. Emotional episodes follow a pattern of ramping up and then slowly decreasing. Episodes cause significant distress and interfere with daily functioning. How to Treat a Labile Affect A labile affect that is not severe might not require treatment. However, for many people, symptoms significantly interfere with daily life. Treatment for a labile affect can include medications and therapy."
aids,"HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus. While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can. There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan. Symptoms of HIV infection Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected. Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested. Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk. Causes of HIV infection HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk. It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include: sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.

alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) due to excessive intake of alcohol. Patients typically have a history of at least 10 years of heavy alcohol intake, typically 8–10 drinks per day. It is usually found in association with fatty liver, an early stage of alcoholic liver disease, and may contribute to the progression of fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis. Symptoms may present acutely after a large amount of alcoholic intake in a short time period, or after years of excess alcohol intake. Signs and symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), fatigue and hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure). Mild cases are self-limiting, but severe cases have a high risk of death. Severity in alcoholic hepatitis is determined several clinical prediction models such as the Maddrey's Discriminant Function and the MELD score. Severe cases may be treated with glucocorticoids with a response rate of about 60%. The condition often comes on suddenly and may progress in severity very rapidly. Signs and symptoms Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by a number of symptoms, which may include feeling unwell, enlargement of the liver, development of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), and modest elevation of liver enzyme levels (as determined by liver function tests). It may also present with Hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure) causing symptoms such as confusion, decreased levels of consciousness, or asterixis, (a characteristic flapping movement when the wrist is extended indicative of hepatic encephalopathy). Severe cases are characterized by profound jaundice, obtundation (ranging from drowsiness to unconsciousness), and progressive critical illness; the mortality rate is 50% within 30 days of onset despite best care. Alcoholic hepatitis is distinct from cirrhosis caused by long-term alcohol consumption. Alcoholic hepatitis can occur in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis by itself does not lead to cirrhosis, but cirrhosis is more common in patients with long term alcohol consumption. Some alcoholics develop acute hepatitis as an inflammatory reaction to the cells affected by fatty change. This is not directly related to the dose of alcohol. Some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. This inflammatory reaction to the fatty change is called alcoholic steatohepatitis and the inflammation probably predisposes to liver fibrosis by activating hepatic stellate cells to produce collagen."
allergy,"An allergy is where your body reacts to something that's normally harmless like pollen, dust or animal fur. The symptoms can be mild, but for some people they can be very serious. Causes of allergies Things that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. Common allergens include: tree and grass pollen (hay fever), house dust mites, foods, such as peanuts, milk and eggs (food allergy), animals, particularly pets like cats and dogs, insect stings, such as bee and wasp stings, certain medicines. Check if it's an allergy Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include: a runny nose or sneezing, pain or tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead, coughing, wheezing or breathlessness, itchy skin or a raised rash (hives), diarrhoea, feeling or being sick, swollen eyes, lips, mouth or throat. Treatments for allergies include: trying to avoid the thing you're allergic to whenever possible, medicines for mild allergic reactions like antihistamines, steroid tablets and steroid creams, emergency medicines called adrenaline auto-injectors, such as an EpiPen, for severe allergic reactions, desensitisation (immunotherapy) for severe allergic reactions – this involves carefully exposing you to the thing you're allergic to over time, so your body gradually gets used to it and does not react so badly (this should only be done by a medical professional). Your specialist will give you an allergy management plan that will explain how to manage your allergy."
alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. It can affect memory, thinking skills and other mental abilities. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age, a family history of the condition, untreated depression, although depression can also be one of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places, difficulty planning or making decisions, problems with speech and language, problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks, personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue), low mood or anxiety. Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. But around 1 in every 13 people with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is called early- or young-onset Alzheimer's disease. Getting a diagnosis As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. Also, the disease process itself may (but not always) prevent people recognising changes in their memory. But Alzheimer's disease is not a ""normal"" part of the ageing process. An accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP."
anxiety state,"Anxiety state or Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common mental health condition where you often feel very anxious about lots of different things. The main symptom of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is feelings of stress or worry that affect your daily life and are difficult to control. Other symptoms of GAD may include: difficulty sleeping, feeling restless, irritable or finding it difficult to concentrate, getting tired easily, feeling tense, stomach problems. How generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is diagnosed If you see a GP about symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), they'll ask you some questions about your worries and physical symptoms. It's important to try and be honest with them, even if it may be difficult to talk about your emotions. This will help them to diagnose or rule out an anxiety disorder. A GP may diagnose GAD if you have the typical symptoms and: you often worry about a wide range of things, feelings of anxiety are affecting your daily life, you're finding it hard to control your feelings, you have felt anxious a lot of the time for at least 6 months, a more noticeable or unusual heartbeat (palpitations), feeling lightheaded or dizzy, low mood or depression. There are also other types of anxiety disorder and it's common to have more than one at the same time. For example: sudden attacks of anxiety and panic (panic disorder), an overwhelming fear of something specific (phobias)."
bacteremia,"Bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in your blood. If you have symptoms, they’re usually mild. Bacteria can enter your blood in different ways, including wounds, medical procedures and even brushing or flossing your teeth too hard. Your blood is typically sterile, meaning it doesn’t have any bacteria or other germs. Bacteria can enter your blood in many possible ways, but it typically happens through skin wounds like cuts, scrapes or burns. Other common names for bacteremia are bloodstream infection (BSI) and blood poisoning. How serious is bacteremia? Bacteremia can be a serious condition, especially in people with weak immune systems that may be unable to fight off infections. Without treatment, bacteremia can cause other infections in your body. Can bacteremia be fatal? Yes, without treatment, bacteremia can progress to sepsis. Sepsis can cause organ failure and death. What are the symptoms of bacteremia? When your immune system recognizes bacteria in your blood, it removes them from your body, usually without any symptoms or only a mild fever. However, if bacteremia progresses to sepsis or septic shock, you may develop symptoms, such as: Chills. Fast heart rate (tachycardia). Low blood pressure (hypotension). Abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting. Diarrhea. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation)."
benign prostatic hypertrophy," Benign Prostatic hypertrophy or Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the medical term for an enlarged prostate. The condition affects the prostate gland in men. The enlargement isn’t caused by cancer or infection. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen. What is an enlarged prostate (BPH)? An enlarged prostate is when your prostate gland becomes larger than normal. It's also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH for short. Benign means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting prostate cancer. Usually, the prostate gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common prostate condition in people over age 50. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder. Over time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra. When this happens, your bladder may not empty completely when you urinate. A narrowed urethra and weak bladder cause many of the urinary problems you may have with BPH. What causes an enlarged prostate (BPH)? Researchers aren't sure why the prostate keeps growing. Some researchers think changes in hormones with aging may cause the prostate to get bigger. What are the symptoms of BPH? Symptoms of BPH include: Having a frequent or urgent need to urinate. Waking up many times to urinate. Having problems with urine flow, such as: Trouble starting to urinate. A stream that's weak, slow, or stops and starts. Dribbling after urination. Urinary incontinence. Feeling that you can't completely empty your bladder. Pain after ejaculation or during urination. Urine with an unusual color or smell. It's important to see your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms because they could be from a more serious health problem. You should get medical help right away if you: Can't urinate at all. Have fever and chills with urination that's painful, frequent, and urgent. Have blood in your urine. Have pain in your lower abdomen (belly) and urinary tract."
biliary calculus,"Bile duct stones, also known as biliary calculi, are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in the bile ducts. These stones can cause blockage and inflammation in the bile ducts, leading to symptoms such as pain, jaundice, and infection.Which are the symptoms?Pain (biliary colic); although gallstones can migrate into the duodenum without giving symptoms, in the vast majority of cases, they cause a sudden pain in the upper and right part of the abdomen that can then last from a few minutes to hours, be intermittent and radiate to the right side as well as being associated with other symptoms; Nausea; Vomiting; Fever; in particular, fever with chills is observed for bacterial infection of the bile that stagnates when stones obstruct, even temporarily, the bile ducts (acute cholangitis); Jaundice; it is an expression of complete obstruction of the main biliary tract by stones. How is it treated? The removal of stones from the gallbladder is accomplished through cholecystectomy, usually performed laparoscopically (VLC). Instead, stone removal from the biliary tract is commonly performed through an endoscopic procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). Through this procedure, stones are extracted from the biliary tract by performing what is known as a biliary sphincterotomy, a small cut in Oddi's sphincter, a muscular structure located where the main biliary route enters the duodenum. When stones are large and cannot be extracted with standard methods (basket or balloon), they can be fragmented with laser or electrohydraulic probes under direct endoscopic vision of the stones (cholangioscopy with lithotripsy). In the presence of biliary tract stones complicated by cholangitis, in addition to supportive medical therapy, including antibiotic therapy, the goal of ERCP is to remove the stones as soon as possible. When bile duct stones are associated with the presence of stones in the gallbladder (cholelithiasis), ERCP is usually performed before cholecystectomy. Calculi located in the intra-hepatic biliary tract are more difficult to remove with ERCP than calculi in the extra-hepatic biliary tract."
bronchial asthma,"Bronchial asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing. It is often triggered by allergens (such as pollen, dust, or pet dander), exercise, respiratory infections, or environmental factors like cold air. Symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness, particularly at night or early in the morning. Asthma attacks can be mild to severe and may be life-threatening if not properly managed."
candidiasis,"Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of yeast in your body. Healthy bacteria help balance the amount of yeast and disruption of this balance leads to an infection. Antifungal medications treat candidiasis and clear the infection between two days to two weeks, depending on severity. Candidiasis is caused by an overgrowth of a type of yeast that lives on your body (Candida albicans). It often appears on your skin, vagina, or mouth, where Candida naturally lives in small amounts. Healthy bacteria on your body prevent yeast overgrowth. Imagine a two-armed scale with healthy bacteria on one side and yeast on the other. The scale stays balanced until disruption occurs from stress, a poor diet, a weakened immune system, or an uncontrolled medical condition. When disrupted, a candidiasis infection occurs. Candidiasis can affect anyone since yeast naturally lives in our bodies and can easily disrupt the balance of yeast and healthy bacteria. Candidiasis most often affects: People with diabetes, People who are pregnant, Babies and infants, People who wear dentures, Hospitalized individuals, and Catheter users. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the infection and include: Red patch of skin (rash) with small, raised bumps (pustules), Itching, Burning sensation, Vaginal discharge (white or yellow), White patches or sores in your mouth causing loss of taste or pain when eating or swallowing, and Swelling (inflammation)."
carcinoma,"Carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the epithelial cells, which line the surfaces of the body and its organs. It is the most common type of cancer and can develop in various organs, including the lungs, breasts, colon, prostate, and skin. Carcinomas are generally classified into two main subtypes: adenocarcinomas, which arise from glandular tissue, and squamous cell carcinomas, which originate from squamous cells found in the skin or mucous membranes."
carcinoma breast,"Breast cancer is cancer that starts in the tissues of the breast. There are two main types of breast cancer: Ductal carcinoma, which starts in the tubes (ducts) that carry milk from the breast to the nipple and is the most common type, and Lobular carcinoma, which starts in the parts of the breast called lobules that produce milk. Early breast cancer often does not cause symptoms, making regular screening important to detect it early. As cancer grows, symptoms may include: a breast lump or a lump in the armpit that is hard, has uneven edges, and usually does not hurt; changes in breast or nipple size, shape, or feel, including redness, dimpling, or puckering that resembles the texture of an orange; and nipple discharge that may be bloody, clear to yellow, green, or pus-like. In men, breast cancer symptoms include a breast lump, breast pain, and tenderness. Advanced breast cancer symptoms may include: bone pain, shortness of breath, swelling of lymph nodes in the armpit (near the affected breast), and weight loss. Talk to your healthcare provider about how often to have a mammogram or other tests to screen for breast cancer. Early detection through mammograms greatly increases the chances of curing breast cancer. Mammography is typically recommended for women starting at age 40 and is generally repeated every 1 to 2 years. For women with a family history of breast cancer, additional risk assessment and testing may be necessary. Mammograms are most effective for women aged 40 to 74, while their effectiveness in women over 75 is less certain. Tamoxifen is approved for breast cancer prevention in women aged 35 and older at high risk, and raloxifene is approved for postmenopausal women. Speak with your provider to discuss appropriate preventive measures."
carcinoma colon,"Colon cancer, also known as bowel cancer, can be found anywhere in the large bowel, including the colon and rectum. Symptoms may include changes in bowel habits, such as softer stools, diarrhea, or constipation that is unusual for you; needing to pass stools more or less often than usual; blood in stools, which may appear red or black; bleeding from the rectum; frequent urges to have a bowel movement even after recently using the toilet; abdominal pain; a lump in the abdomen; bloating; unexplained weight loss; and extreme fatigue. Bowel cancer may also lead to anemia, causing tiredness, shortness of breath, and headaches."
carcinoma of lung,"Carcinoma of Lung  or Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious cancers, with over 43,000 cases diagnosed annually in the UK. Symptoms often don’t appear in early stages, but may include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, persistent breathlessness, unexplained fatigue, weight loss, and pain when breathing or coughing. Types of lung cancer include primary lung cancer, which originates in the lungs, and secondary lung cancer, which spreads to the lungs from other areas. Primary lung cancer has two main forms: non-small-cell lung cancer (80-85% of cases), which includes squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma; and small-cell lung cancer, which spreads more quickly. The type of lung cancer affects the recommended treatments."
carcinoma prostate,"Carcinoma prostate or Prostate cancer is a slow-developing cancer, often with no symptoms for many years. Symptoms appear once the prostate is large enough to impact the urethra, causing issues such as an increased need to urinate, straining during urination, and feeling as though the bladder is not fully emptied. While these symptoms don't necessarily indicate prostate cancer, they should be checked. Causes are largely unknown, but risk factors include age (most cases are in men 50+), family history, ethnicity (higher in black men, lower in Asian men), and obesity."
chicken pox,"Chickenpox is a common, self-limiting illness that primarily affects children but can occur at any age. It typically resolves within 1-2 weeks without requiring a GP visit. The main symptom is an itchy, spotty rash that appears anywhere on the body. Chickenpox progresses in three stages: spots, blisters, and scabs, with new spots sometimes appearing while others blister or scab. Other symptoms include a high temperature, aches, pains, feeling unwell, and loss of appetite. Adults tend to have a higher temperature for longer and more spots than children. Re-infection is possible but rare."
cholecystitis,"Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually occurring when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, which is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones, small stones typically made of cholesterol, are common and affect more than 1 in 10 adults in the UK. Although they often do not cause symptoms, they can lead to episodes of pain known as biliary colic or cause acute cholecystitis, which is potentially serious due to the risk of complications. Acute cholecystitis generally requires hospital treatment, including rest, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics. The main symptom is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right side of the abdomen that spreads towards the right shoulder. This area is usually very tender, and the pain may intensify with deep breathing. Unlike other types of abdominal pain, the pain from acute cholecystitis tends to persist and does not subside within a few hours. Additional symptoms can include a high temperature, nausea, vomiting, sweating, loss of appetite, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a bulge in the abdomen."
cholelithiasis,"Gallstones (cholelithiasis) are hardened pieces of bile that form in your gallbladder or bile ducts. They’re common, especially in women and people assigned female at birth. Gallstones don’t always cause problems, but they can if they get stuck in your biliary tract and block your bile flow. If your gallstones cause you symptoms, you’ll need treatment to remove them — typically, surgery. Gallstones typically don't cause symptoms unless they become lodged and cause a blockage. This blockage can result in symptoms such as upper abdominal pain and nausea, which may be intermittent or persistent. If the blockage is severe or lasts for a long time, additional symptoms may develop, including sweating, fever, a fast heart rate, abdominal swelling and tenderness, a yellow tint to the skin and eyes, dark-colored urine, and light-colored stool."
chronic alcoholic intoxication,"Chronic alcoholic intoxication refers to long-term alcohol abuse, which can lead to severe health problems affecting various organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart. Chronic alcohol use can cause alcoholic liver disease, brain damage, and cardiovascular issues. Symptoms may include tremors, memory loss, fatigue, irritability, and physical symptoms such as jaundice or an enlarged liver. Over time, this can lead to complications such as cirrhosis, pancreatitis, or alcohol-induced dementia. Treatment involves alcohol cessation, nutritional support, and managing complications like liver failure."
chronic cholestasis,"Chronic cholestasis is a condition where bile flow from the liver is reduced or blocked, leading to the accumulation of bile in the liver. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including liver diseases, gallstones, or bile duct obstructions. Symptoms often include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), itching, fatigue, and dark urine. Over time, it can cause liver damage, cirrhosis, or fibrosis. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include medications to improve bile flow, managing the cause of blockage, and in some cases, liver transplant."
chronic kidney failure,"Chronic kidney failure (also called chronic kidney disease or CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function over time. The kidneys become less effective at filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood, which can lead to a buildup of toxins in the body. Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, and a history of kidney disease. Symptoms may not appear in the early stages but can include swelling, fatigue, nausea, and changes in urination. Management includes controlling the underlying conditions, dietary changes, medications, and in advanced cases, dialysis or kidney transplant."
chronic obstructive airway disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe. It is most commonly caused by long-term exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, or dust. COPD includes conditions like emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Symptoms include shortness of breath, chronic cough, wheezing, and fatigue. COPD worsens over time and can lead to complications like respiratory failure or heart problems. While there is no cure, treatment involves medications (such as bronchodilators and steroids), pulmonary rehabilitation, and lifestyle changes to manage symptoms."
coronary arteriosclerosis,"Coronary arteriosclerosis refers to the thickening and hardening of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque, primarily cholesterol, and other substances. This condition narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to chest pain (angina), heart attacks, and other cardiovascular problems. Risk factors include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes. Treatment focuses on lifestyle changes, medications to manage cholesterol and blood pressure, and sometimes surgical interventions such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery."
decubitus ulcer,"Decubitus ulcer or Pressure ulcer also known as bed sores or pressure sores, are areas of skin and tissue damage caused by prolonged pressure or friction, often affecting people who have difficulty moving. They typically develop on bony parts of the body, like the heels, elbows, hips, and tailbone. Symptoms include discolored patches that don’t change color when pressed—red on lighter skin, purple or blue on darker skin—along with warmth, sponginess, hardness, pain, or itchiness. Pressure ulcers form gradually but can sometimes appear within hours. People at higher risk include those with limited mobility, previous ulcers, recent surgery, poor circulation, fragile or sweaty skin, or conditions affecting sensation or weight. If untreated, ulcers may worsen, potentially reaching muscle or bone layers."
 degenerative polyarthritis,"Degenerative polyarthritis, also known as osteoarthritis (OA) when it affects multiple joints, is a condition characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. It is a progressive disease that typically affects weight-bearing joints like the knees, hips, and spine, but can also impact smaller joints such as those in the hands and feet. Symptoms include joint pain, swelling, decreased flexibility, and crepitus (a grating sound during movement). Over time, the cartilage wears down, and the bones may begin to rub together, causing increased pain and potential deformities. Risk factors for degenerative polyarthritis include aging, joint injuries, obesity, and a family history of the disease."
deglutition disorder,"Deglutition disorder, also known as dysphagia, refers to difficulties in swallowing, which may occur at any stage of the swallowing process, from the mouth to the esophagus. The condition can result from neurological disorders (such as stroke or Parkinson’s disease), muscular issues, or anatomical abnormalities. Common symptoms include coughing or choking while eating or drinking, feeling like food is stuck in the throat or chest, and pain while swallowing. In severe cases, dysphagia can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, or aspiration pneumonia due to food or liquids entering the airway.Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include swallowing therapy, changes in diet (such as thickened liquids), medications, or even surgical interventions to address structural issues."
delusion,"Delusional disorder is a mental health condition in which a person struggles to differentiate between reality and imagination, experiencing delusions that vary by type, such as persecutory, jealous, or grandiose delusions. Treatment is possible through psychotherapy and medication. A hallmark of this condition is a lack of self-awareness; individuals often fail to see their delusions as irrational, even if they acknowledge that others view them this way. Persecutory, jealous, or erotomanic delusions can lead to anger and violent behavior, and anxiety or depression may also develop as a result of these beliefs. Early symptoms include feelings of being exploited, excessive concern about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends, interpreting benign remarks or events as threats, holding grudges, and being quick to react to perceived slights."
dependence,"Dependence refers to a state where an individual becomes reliant on a substance or behavior, typically due to addiction. This can involve physical dependence, where the body adapts to a substance and requires it to function normally, and psychological dependence, where a person feels compelled to engage in a behavior or consume a substance. Substance dependence, such as alcohol or drug dependence, can lead to withdrawal symptoms when the substance is reduced or stopped. Treatment involves medical intervention, counseling, and behavioral therapy to help the individual break free from dependency and manage withdrawal symptoms."
depression mental,"Mental depression, or clinical depression, is a serious mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in daily activities. This condition can impact how a person thinks, feels, and functions, and may lead to physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite, and sleep disturbances. It is commonly associated with a chemical imbalance in the brain. Risk factors include genetics, traumatic events, chronic illness, or prolonged stress. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, medications such as antidepressants, and lifestyle changes aimed at improving emotional well-being."
depressive disorder,"Depressive disorder, often referred to as major depressive disorder or MDD, is characterized by persistent low mood, lack of interest in activities, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. It is a severe form of depression that can interfere with daily functioning and often requires professional treatment. Symptoms include sadness, loss of appetite, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Treatment may involve antidepressants, psychotherapy, and in some cases, lifestyle modifications, like exercise and support groups."
dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Dimorphic hemorrhoids, commonly known as piles, are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus that can cause discomfort, pain, and bleeding. There are two types: internal hemorrhoids (inside the rectum) and external hemorrhoids (under the skin around the anus). Symptoms include itching, pain during bowel movements, and bleeding. The condition is often caused by straining during bowel movements, pregnancy, or prolonged sitting. Treatment includes dietary changes, over-the-counter creams, sitz baths, and in severe cases, surgical intervention."
drug reaction,"A drug reaction refers to an adverse response the body has to a medication, which can range from mild allergic reactions to severe, life-threatening conditions. Symptoms can include rashes, fever, difficulty breathing, and gastrointestinal upset. The severity of the reaction depends on the individual and the drug involved. Immediate medical attention is often necessary to manage severe reactions like anaphylaxis. Treatment typically involves discontinuing the drug and, if necessary, administering medications to counteract the symptoms."
edema pulmonary,"Pulmonary edema is a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. This can occur due to heart problems (cardiogenic pulmonary edema) or other causes, such as kidney failure or high altitudes. Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and rapid breathing. Pulmonary edema is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment, which may include medications to reduce fluid buildup and oxygen therapy."
effusion pericardial,"Pericardial effusion occurs when excess fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. This can interfere with the heart's ability to pump effectively. Causes may include infection, trauma, cancer, or inflammatory conditions. Symptoms often include shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, but mild cases may be asymptomatic. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the effusion, which may include medications or, in some cases, drainage of the fluid."
embolism pulmonary,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, usually caused by a blood clot that travels to the lungs from the legs (deep vein thrombosis). Symptoms include sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood, and rapid heartbeat. Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate treatment, often involving blood thinners or clot-dissolving drugs."
emphysema pulmonary,"Pulmonary emphysema is a chronic lung condition that involves the destruction of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, leading to reduced surface area for gas exchange and difficulty breathing. It is most commonly caused by smoking. Symptoms include shortness of breath, chronic cough, and wheezing. Emphysema is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and while it cannot be reversed, treatments like bronchodilators, steroids, and oxygen therapy can help manage symptoms."
encephalopathy,"Encephalopathy refers to a broad term for any disease that affects the brain, leading to altered mental status. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, liver or kidney failure, trauma, or toxins. Symptoms include confusion, memory loss, altered behavior, and, in severe cases, seizures or coma. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, such as infection or metabolic imbalances, to restore brain function."
exanthema,"Exanthema is a general term for a skin rash or eruption that occurs as a result of an underlying infection or disease. It is often associated with viral infections such as measles, rubella, or chickenpox. The rash can vary in appearance, but common signs include red or inflamed patches of skin that may be itchy or blistering. Treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and addressing the underlying cause, such as antiviral or antibiotic medications, if appropriate."
failure heart,"Heart failure means that the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly. It usually happens because the heart has become too weak or stiff. It's sometimes called congestive heart failure, although this name is not widely used now. Heart failure does not mean your heart has stopped working. It means it needs some support to help it work better. It can occur at any age, but is most common in older people. Heart failure is a long-term condition that tends to get gradually worse over time. It cannot usually be cured, but the symptoms can often be controlled for many years. Symptoms of heart failure: The main symptoms of heart failure are: breathlessness after activity or at rest, feeling tired most of the time and finding exercise exhausting, feeling lightheaded or fainting, swollen ankles and legs. Some people also experience other symptoms, such as a persistent cough, a fast heart rate and dizziness. Symptoms can develop quickly (acute heart failure) or gradually over weeks or"

failure kidney,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not function as well as they should. It’s common, often linked with aging, and more prevalent in individuals who are black or of South Asian origin. CKD can worsen over time, but complete kidney failure is uncommon, and many people with CKD live long lives. Early stages usually have no symptoms and may only be detected through blood or urine tests. Advanced CKD symptoms can include tiredness, swollen ankles, feet or hands, shortness of breath, nausea, and blood in urine. See a GP if you have persistent or concerning symptoms that may indicate kidney disease."
fibroid tumor,"A fibroid tumor is a non-cancerous growth that develops in or around the uterus. Also known as uterine fibroids, these tumors are typically made of muscle and fibrous tissue. Many women experience no symptoms, while others may suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, frequent urination, or complications during pregnancy. The exact cause of fibroid tumors is unknown, but they are influenced by hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone. Risk factors include age (more common in women 30-40 years old), family history, and race (more common in African American women). Treatment may involve medications, hormonal therapy, or surgical interventions like myomectomy or hysterectomy."
fungal infection,"A fungal infection is caused by an overgrowth of fungi, such as yeasts or molds, in or on the body. Common types include athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis, and histoplasmosis. Symptoms vary depending on the type and location of the infection but often include itching, redness, swelling, and flaky skin. In more severe cases, fungal infections can affect internal organs and require antifungal medications. Risk factors include a weakened immune system, diabetes, use of antibiotics, or poor hygiene. Treatment typically involves topical antifungal creams or oral antifungal medications."
gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis, often referred to as stomach flu, is the inflammation of the stomach and intestines caused by infections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites. The most common viruses causing gastroenteritis are norovirus and rotavirus. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, and sometimes fever. Gastroenteritis is highly contagious and can spread through contaminated food, water, or contact with infected individuals. Most cases resolve within a few days, but dehydration can be a concern, particularly in young children and older adults. Treatment focuses on staying hydrated and managing symptoms, while more severe cases may require antibiotics or antivirals."
gerd,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the stomach contents leak backward from the stomach into the esophagus (food pipe). Food travels from your mouth to the stomach through your esophagus. GERD can irritate the food pipe and cause heartburn and other symptoms.CausesWhen you eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).When this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux may cause symptoms. Harsh stomach acids can also damage the lining of the esophagus.The risk factors for reflux include:Use of alcohol (possibly)Hiatal hernia(a condition in which part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities)ObesityPregnancySclerodermaSmoking or tobacco useLying down within 3 hours after eatingHeartburn and gastroesophageal reflux can be caused by or made worse by pregnancy. Symptoms can also be caused by certain medicines, such as:Anticholinergics (for example, sea"
hemiparesis,"Hemiparesis is a condition characterized by weakness or partial paralysis on one side of the body, typically resulting from brain injury or neurological disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, or brain tumors. The affected side may experience weakness in the arm, leg, or face, and the individual may have difficulty with motor control, balance, and coordination. The severity of hemiparesis can range from mild weakness to near-total paralysis. Treatment focuses on rehabilitation through physical therapy, occupational therapy, and in some cases, medications to manage underlying causes like stroke or neurological conditions."
hepatitis d,"Hepatitis D is a viral liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which only occurs in people infected with hepatitis B (HBV). This is because HDV requires HBV to replicate. Hepatitis D is primarily transmitted through contact with infected blood, and it can worsen the liver damage caused by hepatitis B, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Symptoms of hepatitis D are similar to those of hepatitis B, including jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark urine. Prevention involves vaccination against hepatitis B, which can also prevent hepatitis D."
hepatitis e,"Hepatitis E is a viral liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). It is primarily transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water, making it more common in areas with poor sanitation. Most cases of hepatitis E are self-limiting and resolve on their own without long-term effects. However, it can be severe and even fatal in pregnant women, particularly during the third trimester. Symptoms include jaundice, nausea, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark urine. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for hepatitis E, good hygiene practices and clean drinking water are key to prevention."
hiv,"HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus. While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can. There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan. Symptoms of HIV infection Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected. Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested. Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk. Causes of HIV infection HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk. It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include: sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex. HIV from infected blood before 1996 If you received a blood transfusion or blood products before 1996, there's a chance you may have been infected with HIV. Diagnosing HIV Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. It's important to be aware that: emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help: clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Treatment for HIV Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test."

hyperbilirubinemia,"Hyperbilirubinemia refers to an excess of bilirubin in the blood, which can cause jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes. This condition can arise from various causes, such as liver diseases (like cirrhosis or autoimmune hepatitis), gallbladder issues (such as gallstones), certain infections (like viral hepatitis), or genetic conditions like Gilbert’s syndrome or Dubin-Johnson syndrome. In some cases, it can also result from medications, toxins, or hemolytic anemia, where the breakdown of red blood cells releases more bilirubin than the liver can process.Symptoms of hyperbilirubinemia often include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (scleral icterus), darker urine, and occasionally abdominal pain or fatigue. The condition itself can indicate an underlying problem with the liver or biliary system, and untreated, it can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure)​."
hypercholesterolemia,"Hypercholesterolemia, or high cholesterol, is a condition where cholesterol levels in the blood are elevated, leading to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. High cholesterol typically does not show symptoms, so it’s diagnosed through blood tests like a lipid panel. The condition can lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries (atherosclerosis), restricting blood flow. It can result from unhealthy lifestyle choices (poor diet, lack of exercise), genetics, or other conditions like diabetes or hypothyroidism. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and medications such as statins to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels."
hyperglycemia,"High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) occurs when the sugar level in your blood is too high, commonly affecting people with diabetes. If untreated, it can be serious. Symptoms usually develop gradually and may begin when blood sugar levels become very high. Common symptoms include: feeling very thirsty, frequent urination, weakness or tiredness, blurred vision, and weight loss. Causes of high blood sugar include: being unwell, feeling stressed, eating too much sugary or starchy food, being less active than usual, missing doses of diabetes medicine. Other factors include ineffective diabetes medicine, certain medications (e.g., steroids), or having recently undergone surgery."
hyperlipidemia,"Hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids (fats), especially cholesterol, in the blood. High cholesterol is often linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. It can result from factors such as a poor diet, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition.

hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels drop below normal levels. It is most common in people with diabetes, especially when taking insulin or other diabetes medications. Symptoms include dizziness, sweating, shakiness, confusion, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. Treatment involves immediate consumption of glucose or sugar, and prevention includes adjusting medication, eating regular meals, and monitoring blood sugar levels closely."
ileus,"Ileus is a condition in which the normal movement of the intestines is disrupted, leading to a build-up of food, fluids, and gas within the intestines. It is often caused by surgery, medications, infections, or abdominal trauma. Symptoms include abdominal bloating, pain, nausea, vomiting, and inability to pass gas or stool. Treatment typically involves fasting the patient to allow the bowel to rest, fluid replacement, and addressing the underlying cause​."
incontinence,"Incontinence refers to the inability to control bodily functions, particularly the bladder and bowels. It can result from conditions like aging, neurological disorders, or pelvic floor weakness. Symptoms include urinary leaks, frequent urges to urinate, and inability to control bowel movements. Treatment may include physical therapy, medications, bladder training, or surgery, depending on the type and severity of incontinence​"
infection,"Infection refers to the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites in the body, often leading to disease. Infections can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, respiratory system, urinary tract, and internal organs. They are typically characterized by symptoms such as fever, pain, swelling, and fatigue, although some infections may not exhibit noticeable symptoms."
 infection urinary tract,"Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): UTIs are infections that affect any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. UTIs are more common in women and are often caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract.

See a GP if you have persistent or concerning symptoms that may indicate kidney disease."
lymphatic diseases,"These refer to disorders affecting the lymphatic system, a part of the immune system comprising lymph nodes, vessels, and lymph fluid. Common lymphatic diseases include lymphedema (swelling due to lymph fluid buildup), lymphangitis (infection in lymph vessels), and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). Lymphatic diseases can stem from infections, cancer, or immune system issues and cause symptoms like swelling, fever, fatigue, and pain. Treatment depends on the specific condition and may include antibiotics, physical therapy, or, in cancer cases, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation"
lymphoma,"Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and glands throughout your body. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system, carrying lymph fluid that contains infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes. In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a type of lymphocyte) multiply abnormally and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, like lymph nodes. These affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting abilities, increasing vulnerability to infection. The most common symptom is painless swelling in a lymph node, typically in the neck, armpit, or groin."
malignant neoplasm of breast,"This cancer begins in breast cells and can spread to surrounding tissue. Symptoms include a lump in the breast, changes in breast shape, or skin dimpling. Factors such as genetics, hormone therapy, and lifestyle may contribute to risk. Treatment options are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, often determined by cancer stage and subtype. Regular screenings are crucial, as early-stage breast cancer has a better survival rate​"
malignant neoplasm of lung,"Carcinoma of Lung  or Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious cancers, with over 43,000 cases diagnosed annually in the UK. Symptoms often don’t appear in early stages, but may include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, persistent breathlessness, unexplained fatigue, weight loss, and pain when breathing or coughing. Types of lung cancer include primary lung cancer, which originates in the lungs, and secondary lung cancer, which spreads to the lungs from other areas. Primary lung cancer has two main forms: non-small-cell lung cancer (80-85% of cases), which includes squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma; and small-cell lung cancer, which spreads more quickly. The type of lung cancer affects the recommended treatments."
malignant neoplasm of prostate,"Prostate cancer affects the prostate gland in men, with risk increasing with age, family history, and race (higher in African American men). Symptoms may include difficulty urinating, blood in urine, and pelvic pain. Prostate cancer is often slow-growing, but aggressive forms exist. Treatment ranges from active surveillance in low-risk cases to surgery, radiation, or hormone therapy. PSA screenings can help detect it early​"
malignant neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms, or cancerous tumors, occur when cells grow uncontrollably, invading nearby tissues and spreading. Symptoms vary depending on the type but may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, lumps, or organ-specific symptoms. Factors like genetics, environment, and lifestyle contribute to cancer risk. Treatment typically includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or targeted therapies, often tailored to the cancer’s type and stage​"
malignant tumor of colon,"Colon cancer begins in the large intestine, often as polyps that become cancerous over time. Symptoms can include changes in bowel habits, blood in stool, and abdominal discomfort. Risk factors include age, diet, family history, and conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. Screening tests like colonoscopies are essential, as early detection significantly improves outcomes. Treatments may involve surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, depending on the stage"
manic disorder,"Manic disorder, part of bipolar disorder, involves extreme mood elevation (mania), where individuals may experience high energy, reduced need for sleep, impulsiveness, and sometimes psychosis. Triggers can include stress, genetics, or lifestyle. Diagnosis requires a mental health professional’s assessment, and treatment includes mood stabilizers, psychotherapy, and lifestyle modifications to manage symptoms and reduce mania frequency. Early treatment helps stabilize mood and improve life quality"
migraine disorders,"Migraines are a type of neurological disorder characterized by severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and sometimes aura (visual or sensory disturbances). They can be triggered by factors such as stress, hormonal changes, certain foods, or environmental stimuli. Migraines may last from hours to days and can be debilitating. Treatment involves medications to alleviate symptoms, preventive drugs, lifestyle changes, and avoiding known triggers. Early treatment at symptom onset often reduces severity​"
mitral valve insufficiency,"Also known as mitral regurgitation, this occurs when the mitral valve in the heart doesn’t close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. This can lead to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Causes include valve prolapse, infections, or damage from a heart attack. Treatment ranges from medications to manage symptoms to surgical repair or replacement for severe cases"
myocardial infarction,"Heart Attack or A myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked, usually due to a clot, causing damage to heart muscle tissue. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating. Immediate medical attention is essential to restore blood flow and limit damage. Treatment involves medications, lifestyle changes, and sometimes procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery"
neoplasm,"A neoplasm is an abnormal and excessive growth of tissue, formed through a process called neoplasia. Unlike normal tissue, a neoplasm grows uncoordinatedly and continues to grow abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed. This abnormal growth usually forms a mass, often referred to as a tumor. Neoplasms can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous)."
neoplasm metastasis,"Metastasis refers to the spread of cancer cells from the primary site to other body parts, commonly affecting organs like the lungs, liver, and bones. Symptoms vary based on the organs involved and may include pain, fatigue, and organ-specific symptoms. Treatment focuses on controlling the spread and alleviating symptoms, using a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies​."
neuropathy,"Neuropathy, or nerve damage, affects the peripheral nerves, causing pain, tingling, numbness, and muscle weakness. It’s commonly associated with diabetes, infections, or injury. Types include peripheral, autonomic, and focal neuropathy, depending on affected nerves. Treatment involves managing symptoms, controlling underlying causes, and lifestyle adjustments to reduce pain and improve nerve function"
neutropenia,"Neutropenia is a low level of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important for fighting infections. It can result from bone marrow disorders, chemotherapy, infections, or autoimmune diseases. Symptoms include frequent infections, fever, and chills. Treatment depends on the cause and may include medications to stimulate white blood cell production, antibiotics, or lifestyle changes to reduce infection risk​"
obesity morbid,"This severe form of obesity significantly increases the risk of conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and sleep apnea. Body mass index (BMI) over 40 typically indicates morbid obesity. Symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, and shortness of breath. Treatment focuses on weight loss through lifestyle changes, medical interventions, or bariatric surgery for long-term improvement in health"
oral candidiasis,"Oral thrush is usually harmless. It's common in babies and also older people with dentures. It can be treated with antifungal mouth gel. Other symptoms in adults are: cracks at the corners of the mouth, not tasting things properly, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, pain inside the mouth (for example, a sore tongue or sore gums), difficulty eating and drinking. Oral thrush in adults is not contagious."
osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes joints to become painful and stiff. It's the most common type of arthritis in the UK. Symptoms of osteoarthritis include joint pain, stiffness, and problems moving the joint. Some people also have symptoms such as swelling, tenderness, and a grating or crackling sound when moving the affected joints. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly between individuals and affected joints. Some people experience mild, occasional symptoms, while others face continuous, severe issues that interfere with daily activities. Commonly affected joints include the knees, hips, and small joints of the hands. See your GP if you have persistent symptoms for diagnosis and treatment."
overload fluid,"overload fluid or Hypervolemia, also known as fluid overload, is a condition where there’s an excess of fluid volume in the body, affecting the functioning of organs. It's commonly seen in individuals with heart and kidney conditions or in pregnancy. Treatment aims to reduce fluid levels in the body. Signs and symptoms of hypervolemia vary, ranging from swelling in the arms and legs, stomach bloating, mild discomfort like cramping or headaches, and quick weight gain. Severe symptoms needing urgent care include high blood pressure, shortness of breath, and heart failure. Seek emergency treatment if you experience severe symptoms."
pancreatitis,"Acute pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. Located behind the stomach, the pancreas aids digestion. Most people recover within a week without further issues, but severe cases can lead to serious complications. Acute pancreatitis differs from chronic pancreatitis, where long-term inflammation causes permanent damage. Common symptoms include sudden severe pain in the center of the abdomen, nausea or vomiting, and a high fever of 38°C or more."
pancytopenia,"Pancytopenia describes having low levels of all three blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, with each type associated with specific conditions. Low red blood cells or hemoglobin, called anemia, means less oxygen is transported to body tissues, causing symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, irregular heartbeat, and pale skin. Low white blood cells, or leukopenia, weakens the body's infection defense, and low neutrophils is termed neutropenia. Low platelets, or thrombocytopenia, impacts blood clotting. Symptoms vary in severity, from unnoticed in mild cases to potentially life-threatening in severe cases requiring emergency care."
paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"A brain bleed (intracranial hemorrhage) is a type of stroke where blood pools between the brain and skull, cutting off oxygen to the brain. This life-threatening condition requires immediate treatment; contact emergency services if you experience a sudden headache, confusion, and numbness on one side of your body. Symptoms vary by type but can include sudden tingling, weakness, numbness, or paralysis on one side, a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, dizziness, slurred speech, sleepiness, difficulty swallowing, vision loss, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, loss of balance, trouble breathing, seizures, and even loss of consciousness or coma."
paranoia,"Paranoia involves feelings of distrust and suspicion about others without a good reason, often involving thoughts that others are out to harm you. It can also extend to concerns about threats to other people, culture, or society. Paranoia varies in severity, can be temporary or long-lasting, and is the most common symptom of psychosis, affecting over 70% of people with psychosis. However, mild paranoia is common even in the general population. Paranoia can be a type of delusion, an unshakeable belief in something untrue, though not all delusions involve harm or threats. Types of paranoia include mistrust (over-suspicion without evidence), interpersonal sensitivity (assigning negative meanings to others’ remarks), ideas of reference (false beliefs that random events relate to you), and persecutory beliefs (belief that someone is trying to harm or spy on you). The severity of paranoia depends on how strongly you believe, think about, feel distressed by, or experience life disruption due to the paranoid thoughts. Many experience mild, nonclinical paranoia at times, which is typically temporary. Severe paranoia, such as persecutory delusions, is rare and is considered clinically significant."
paroxysmal dyspnea,"Paroxysmal dyspnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, is sudden shortness of breath that typically occurs during sleep, often linked to heart failure. This condition happens when lying down increases fluid accumulation in the lungs. Symptoms include waking up gasping for air and a feeling of suffocation. Treatment focuses on managing underlying heart or lung conditions, using medications to reduce fluid buildup, and lifestyle adjustments​"
peptic ulcer diseae,"Peptic ulcer disease involves sores or ulcers forming in the stomach lining or upper intestine, often due to H. pylori bacteria or long-term NSAID use. Symptoms include burning stomach pain, bloating, nausea, and, in severe cases, vomiting blood. Treatment generally involves antibiotics for bacterial infections, medications to reduce stomach acid, and lifestyle changes. Untreated ulcers can lead to complications like bleeding or perforation​"
pericardial effusion body substance,"Pericardial effusion is the accumulation of excess fluid around the heart in the pericardial sac, often caused by infections, inflammation, or injury. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Severe effusions can cause cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening compression of the heart. Treatment varies based on the cause but may involve drainage of fluid, medications, or surgery for recurrent cases"
peripheral vascular disease,"Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): PVD is a circulatory disorder where narrowed blood vessels reduce blood flow to limbs, often due to atherosclerosis. Symptoms include leg pain, cramping, and changes in skin color. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Treatments focus on lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, procedures to improve blood flow. Left untreated, PVD can lead to complications like ulcers and infections"
personality disorder,"Personality disorders are mental health conditions that affect how people perceive themselves and others, leading to difficulties in relationships and everyday functioning. Types include borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial personality disorders, each with unique symptoms like emotional instability, impulsiveness, or detachment. Treatment often includes psychotherapy, medication, and support networks to improve behavior and coping skills​"
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,"Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP): PCP is a serious fungal infection that primarily affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. It causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath, fever, and cough. Early detection is critical, as PCP can be life-threatening. Treatment involves antifungal medications, often combined with oxygen therapy, and preventive measures in high-risk individuals"
pneumonia aspiration,"Aspiration Pneumonia is a lung infection that occurs when foreign substances, such as food, liquid, saliva, or vomit, are inhaled into the lungs. This aspiration introduces bacteria or other particles into the lower respiratory tract, where they can cause inflammation and infection. Aspiration pneumonia is particularly common in individuals with swallowing difficulties, often due to neurological conditions such as stroke, dementia, or Parkinson’s disease. Other risk factors include advanced age, reduced consciousness, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the use of sedatives or alcohol, which can impair the swallowing reflex.Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia are often similar to those of other types of pneumonia, including coughing (sometimes with sputum), fever, chills, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, the infection can lead to complications like lung abscesses or empyema, where pus accumulates in the pleural cavity. Diagnosis typically involves a physical examination, chest X-rays, and sputum cultures to identify the causative organisms."
pneumothorax,"A pneumothorax is when air gets inside your chest cavity and creates pressure against your lung, causing it to collapse partially or fully. Underlying medical conditions, injuries or medical procedures can cause it. Go to the nearest emergency department if you have symptoms of a pneumothorax, including difficulty breathing, chest pain or blue skin, nails or lips. Signs and symptoms of a pneumothorax include: Chest pain on one side, especially when taking breaths. Cough. Fast breathing. Fast heart rate. Fatigue. Shortness of breath (dyspnea). Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis). If you have symptoms of a collapsed lung, go to the nearest emergency room. You may need immediate care."
primary carcinoma of the liver cells,"Primary Carcinoma of the Liver Cells (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) is a type of liver cancer that originates in the liver cells (hepatocytes). It is the most common form of liver cancer and is closely associated with chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B or C infections. Risk factors for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include heavy alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), exposure to aflatoxins (toxins produced by certain molds), and genetic conditions such as hemochromatosis. It is most common in people with a history of liver disease and is more likely to occur in older adults.Symptoms of primary liver carcinoma may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), unexplained weight loss, upper abdominal pain or discomfort, nausea, and swelling of the abdomen due to fluid buildup. In many cases, HCC is diagnosed late when symptoms become more severe, making early detection crucial. Diagnostic procedures include blood tests (such as alpha-fetoprotein levels), imaging tests (ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI), and biopsy for confirmation of the cancer type."
primary malignant neoplasm,"Malignant neoplasms, or cancerous tumors, occur when cells grow uncontrollably, invading nearby tissues and spreading. Symptoms vary depending on the type but may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, lumps, or organ-specific symptoms. Factors like genetics, environment, and lifestyle contribute to cancer risk. Treatment typically includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or targeted therapies, often tailored to the cancer’s type and stage​"
psychotic disorder,"Psychotic Disorder refers to a mental health condition characterized by a disconnection from reality, often manifesting as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and impaired insight. These symptoms significantly affect a person's ability to function in daily life. Psychotic disorders can be caused by a variety of factors, including mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, mood disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder with psychotic features), substance abuse, or medical conditions like brain injuries or infections.Schizophrenia is one of the most well-known psychotic disorders, with symptoms like auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoid delusions. Delusional disorder, another type of psychotic disorder, involves fixed, false beliefs that are not rooted in reality, such as the belief that one is being persecuted or controlled by outside forces. Psychosis can also occur as a result of substance use or withdrawal (e.g., from drugs like cocaine or alcohol) or from medical conditions like tumors or neurological diseases."
pyelonephritis,"Pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that involves the kidneys. It is typically caused by bacteria ascending from the bladder into the kidneys, leading to inflammation and infection. Common symptoms include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, pain in the back or side (flank pain), painful urination, and cloudy or foul-smelling urine. In severe cases, pyelonephritis can lead to kidney damage or sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by widespread infection in the bloodstream.Risk factors for pyelonephritis include having a history of urinary tract infections, urinary tract obstructions (such as kidney stones), anatomical abnormalities, and conditions like diabetes or a weakened immune system. Women are at higher risk, as they have a shorter urethra, making it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and kidneys."
respiratory failure,"Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes both problems occur. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen, which passes into your blood and is carried to your organs, such as the heart and brain, which need this oxygen-rich blood to function properly. Breathing also removes carbon dioxide from the blood. Too much carbon dioxide can harm organs. Symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. A low oxygen level can cause shortness of breath, air hunger (the feeling you can't breathe in enough air), and a bluish color to the skin, lips, and nails. A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion. Some people may become very sleepy or lose consciousness, and may experience arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) if their brain and heart are not getting enough oxygen."
sepsis (invertebrate),"Sepsis is life threatening. It can be hard to spot. There are lots of possible symptoms, which can resemble those of other conditions, including flu or a chest infection. If you think you or someone you look after has symptoms of sepsis, call 999 or go to A&E. Trust your instincts."
sickle cell anemia,"Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S. This causes red blood cells to become rigid and shaped like a crescent (or sickle), which can block blood flow in small vessels, leading to pain, organ damage, and an increased risk of infections. The most common symptoms of sickle cell anemia include episodes of pain (known as sickle cell crises), fatigue, anemia (due to the destruction of sickle cells), and swelling in the hands and feet. It primarily affects individuals of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian ancestry."
spasm bronchial,"Bronchial spasm, also known as bronchoconstriction, is the sudden constriction of the smooth muscles surrounding the airways, leading to difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing. This condition is common in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis. Bronchial spasms can occur due to triggers like allergens, respiratory infections, cold air, or exercise. In asthma, bronchoconstriction is typically reversible with the use of bronchodilators, medications that relax the airway muscles. The symptoms of bronchial spasm can vary from mild wheezing and coughing to severe shortness of breath. During a spasm, the airways narrow, which impedes airflow and makes it hard for air to enter and leave the lungs. Managing bronchial spasms often involves the use of rescue inhalers (short-acting bronchodilators) and controlling underlying conditions with long-term medications such as inhaled corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors."
stenosis aortic valve,"Aortic valve stenosis (or aortic stenosis) happens when the aortic valve in your heart is narrowed or blocked. This interferes with the normal blood flow out of your heart, making your heart work harder and causing heart damage, major health problems, and even death. Replacing the valve is the best treatment and gives you a good prognosis. Aortic stenosis symptoms (progressing from less severe to more severe) include: Fatigue, which can disrupt your normal activities. Heart palpitations (being unpleasantly aware of your own heartbeat). Swelling in your feet, ankles, or lower legs. Chest pain (angina), which can also feel like squeezing, pressure or discomfort and can extend to your neck, jaw, arm or abdomen. Shortness of breath. Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. Your primary care provider may refer you to a cardiologist (heart doctor) if they suspect you have aortic stenosis."
suicide attempt,"A suicide attempt refers to an individual’s deliberate act of trying to end their own life, which may or may not result in injury or death. It is a serious mental health crisis and is often a manifestation of underlying issues such as depression, severe anxiety, or other psychiatric conditions. Warning signs can include extreme mood swings, withdrawal from social relationships, and expressions of hopelessness. Treatment for someone who has attempted suicide typically involves emergency medical care, psychological counseling, and long-term mental health support to address the root causes and reduce the risk of future attempts."
systemic infection,"A systemic infection is an infection that affects the entire body rather than a localized area. These infections can spread via the bloodstream or lymphatic system, often leading to symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue, and organ dysfunction. Common causes of systemic infections include bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In severe cases, sepsis may develop, which is a life-threatening response to infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, or antiviral medications are essential, especially for infections like septicemia, which require immediate medical intervention."
tachycardia sinus,"Sinus tachycardia is a condition where the heart rate exceeds the normal resting rate, typically above 100 beats per minute in adults, originating from the sinus node, the natural pacemaker of the heart. It can occur as a response to various factors like fever, anxiety, physical activity, or blood loss. In some cases, it can be caused by underlying conditions such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, or heart disease. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, and in some cases, medications like beta-blockers may be used to control heart rate."
thrombocytopaenia,"Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood, which can lead to increased bleeding and bruising. Causes can include bone marrow disorders, viral infections, autoimmune diseases, or certain medications. Symptoms can range from mild bruising to heavy bleeding, particularly in the gums or gastrointestinal tract. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include medications to increase platelet count, immune suppressants, or platelet transfusions in severe cases."
thrombus,"A thrombus is a blood clot that forms in a blood vessel and can obstruct blood flow, leading to conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Thrombosis can occur due to factors like injury to the blood vessel, slow blood flow, or changes in blood composition (such as in the case of clotting disorders). Symptoms depend on the location of the thrombus, but may include swelling, pain, redness, or difficulty breathing (in the case of a PE). Treatment typically involves anticoagulants (blood thinners) to prevent further clotting, and in some cases, clot-dissolving drugs or surgery."
tonic-clonic epilepsy,"Tonic-clonic epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures involving two phases: the tonic phase (muscle stiffening) and the clonic phase (muscle jerking). This type of epilepsy is often associated with generalized seizures, meaning that the abnormal electrical activity affects the entire brain. The seizures are typically caused by imbalances in neurotransmitters or brain abnormalities and may be triggered by factors like stress, sleep deprivation, or flashing lights.Symptoms include sudden loss of consciousness, followed by the body becoming stiff (tonic phase) and then jerking violently (clonic phase). After the seizure, individuals often experience confusion, fatigue, and headache. There may also be temporary memory loss and difficulty speaking or understanding language. The condition is usually managed with antiepileptic medications and sometimes lifestyle changes to reduce seizure triggers."
tonic-clonic seizures,"A tonic-clonic seizure is one of the most common types of generalized seizures, also known as grand mal seizures. It involves two stages: the tonic phase, where the muscles stiffen, followed by the clonic phase, where rapid, jerking movements of the body occur. These seizures can cause loss of consciousness, and the person may fall to the ground, leading to injury. They can last from 1 to 3 minutes and may be followed by confusion, exhaustion, or memory loss.Symptoms include loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening, jerking movements, biting the tongue, and incontinence. After the seizure, there is often a postictal period of confusion, fatigue, and disorientation. Treatment typically involves anticonvulsant medications and lifestyle modifications to prevent triggers."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,"Tricuspid valve insufficiency, also known as tricuspid regurgitation, is a heart valve disorder in which the tricuspid valve does not close properly, causing blood to leak backward into the right atrium of the heart. This condition can occur due to heart disease, infections, or structural problems with the valve.Symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling in the abdomen or legs, and heart palpitations. Severe cases can lead to right-sided heart failure, characterized by fluid retention and difficulty breathing. Treatment options include medications to manage symptoms, such as diuretics for fluid retention, and surgical interventions such as valve repair or replacement in more severe cases."
tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection primarily affecting the lungs but can also affect other organs such as the kidneys, spine, and brain. It is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.Symptoms of active TB include a persistent cough (sometimes with blood), fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and chest pain. TB is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, chest X-rays, and sputum tests."
typhoid,"Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body, affecting many organs. Without prompt treatment, it can cause serious complications and can be fatal. It's caused by a bacterium called Salmonella typhi, which is related to the bacteria that cause salmonella food poisoning. Typhoid fever is highly contagious. An infected person can pass the bacteria out of their body in their poo or, less commonly, in their pee. If someone else eats food or drinks water that's been contaminated with a small amount of infected poo or pee, they can become infected with the bacteria and develop typhoid fever."
ulcer peptic,"Peptic ulcer disease is a condition that causes ulcers (open sores) to develop in the lining of your digestive tract. “Peptic” means it’s related to digestion. The word is derived from pepsin, the major digestive enzyme that your stomach produces. Pepsin and stomach acid are the active ingredients in your stomach juices that help to chemically break down food for digestion. Some of these juices also pass into the first part of your small intestine (duodenum). By design, these juices are highly corrosive. All of your gastrointestinal tract has a protective mucous lining that insulates it from the substances inside. It’s especially strong in your stomach and duodenum. But in peptic ulcer disease, this protection fails, and digestive juices corrode through the lining. Symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding may include: Blood in your stool (poop). Black, tarry stool. Coffee ground vomitus. Dizziness or faintness. Pallor (paleness). Rapid heart rate. Symptoms of a gastrointestinal perforation (hole) may include: Sudden, sharp and severe abdominal pain. Abdominal swelling and tenderness to touch. Fever and chills."
upper respiratory infection,"An upper respiratory infection (URI) is a viral or bacterial infection that affects the nose, throat, and sinuses. It is commonly caused by viruses like rhinovirus, influenza, or RSV. Symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, sneezing, mild fever, fatigue, headache, and watery eyes. While URIs are often self-limiting and resolve on their own, symptoms can last from a few days to two weeks. Treatment focuses on symptom relief, such as using decongestants, throat lozenges, pain relievers, and fluids. Complications like ear infections or sinusitis may arise in some cases."
urinary tract infection,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect your urinary tract, including your bladder (cystitis), urethra (urethritis) or kidneys (kidney infection). UTIs may be treated with antibiotics, but they're not always needed. Check if it's a urinary tract infection (UTI). Symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) may include: pain or a burning sensation when peeing (dysuria), needing to pee more often than usual, needing to pee more often than usual during the night (nocturia), needing to pee suddenly or more urgently than usual, pee that looks cloudy, blood in your pee, lower tummy pain or pain in your back, just under the ribs, a high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery, a very low temperature below 36C. Your pee may also be dark or smell. If this is your only symptom, it might be because you've not been drinking enough water. Children"
